Got it! Thanks for the context — that helps shape the tone and structure. Here's the updated version, written as a request from you to Derry (as a fellow lead), asking for help in supporting the intern's request:

Subject: Sample Documents Needed for Bahamas & Curaçao

Hi Derry,

Hope all’s well.

One of the Amplify interns reached out requesting 5 to 10 sample documents per document type for a few jurisdictions. To help them move forward, could you assist with pulling together samples for Bahamas and Curaçao to start?

If it’s something you’re not able to provide directly, no problem—Rajesh mentioned that Donna, Hari, or Charan’s team might be a good fallback, and suggested that routing through Hazel or Amy might be the best way to access those documents.

Let me know what’s possible from your end—really appreciate the support either way.

Best,
Yuri
