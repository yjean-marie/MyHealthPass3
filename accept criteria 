Feature: Ensure fields retain their original values when not updated by Originations

  Scenario: Fields not covered by Originations retain original values
    Given an existing record in the Core Agnostic Domain Service
    And certain fields are not included in the update request
    When the update request is submitted
    Then the fields not covered by Originations should retain their original values
    And no blank (null) values should be stored in the core system for these fields

  Scenario: Fields not covered by Originations are not overwritten with null
    Given an existing record in the Core Agnostic Domain Service
    And certain fields are not updated by Originations
    When the update request is submitted
    Then the fields not covered by Originations should not be overwritten with blank (null) values
    And no existing values should be changed unless explicitly updated

  Scenario: Unit and integration tests validate field retention
    Given an update request excluding certain fields
    When unit tests are run
    Then the tests should confirm that fields not included in the update retain their original values

    And when integration tests are executed
    Then the tests should confirm that no blank (null) values are passed to the core APIs unless specified

  Scenario: Logging for excluded fields
    Given fields not included in an update request
    When the update is processed
    Then logs should be generated confirming that the values for these fields were retained and not changed
