Goal: Cyber & Risk

Objective: Manage IT Risk KRIs to enterprise targets including vulnerability management. Strengthen SRE and automation practices, reduce P1/P2 incidents, and maintain 99.9% system availability.

My Feedback:
I successfully supported the team’s vulnerability management and risk mitigation objectives by directly resolving several P1 vulnerabilities (including Tomcat, DAST, and Aqua findings) ahead of compliance deadlines.
Following the Stonebranch onboarding and new monitoring framework, overall system stability improved, achieving approximately 99.9% uptime across KYC environments.
Additionally, production support monitoring was enhanced through Elastic, Splunk, and Dynatrace, allowing earlier detection and resolution of issues before client impact.
While no formal audit engagements occurred this period, the technical controls and automation implemented contributed to a stronger compliance posture and reduced manual intervention risk.
Overall, the focus on automation, vulnerability remediation, and enhanced observability significantly strengthened operational resilience and service reliability.

Self-Rating: ✅ Fully Met (Achieved All and Exceeded)
Rationale:

P1 vulnerabilities remediated (DAST, Aqua, Tomcat).

99.9% system uptime achieved post-Stonebranch implementation.

Monitoring expanded via Elastic, Splunk, and Dynatrace.

Strong reduction in operational risk through automation and proactive issue detection.
