You‚Äôre making perfect sense üëçüèΩ ‚Äî you want a ‚Äúlight-technical‚Äù section that lays out what‚Äôs required to actually build this thing, but still in BA/business language (not code). Sort of a ‚Äúchecklist of ingredients‚Äù that shows the moving parts without diving into syntax.

Here‚Äôs how you could add that section:

What We Need in Place to Build This

To get the AI Help & Offers Assistant working, a few key components need to be prepared and maintained:

1. Knowledge Base (Support Content)

A central set of documents: FAQs, policies, procedures, product guides.

Version control so we know which policy is active and can show ‚Äúeffective as of‚Äù dates.

A review cycle (monthly/quarterly) to keep documents up to date.


2. Retrieval Setup (How the Assistant Finds Answers)

Document formatting: split long policies into smaller ‚Äúchunks‚Äù with tags (product, country, effective date).

Search tool: the assistant needs a retrieval system that can pull back the most relevant chunk based on the client‚Äôs question.

Answer rules: the assistant must only use approved content and show the source.


3. Offer Rules (Next-Best-Offer Logic)

A rules engine or a documented set of eligibility rules:

Who can be offered what (e.g., must be in good standing, must have consent).

Which countries/products apply.

What to exclude (e.g., clients in arrears).


Disclosures & compliance requirements tied to each offer (APR ranges, fees, terms).

Frequency controls (e.g., max one offer per resolved chat).


4. Customer Data Signals (Without Exposing PII)

A way to pass safe attributes (e.g., ‚Äúhas checking account‚Äù, ‚Äúcountry=TT‚Äù, ‚Äútenure>2 years‚Äù).

Consent flag so the assistant knows if it can show offers.

Strict privacy filters so no sensitive details are sent into the AI model.


5. Handoff Path to Humans

A clear rule set for when to stop and escalate (e.g., fraud, KYC issues).

A handoff summary format so agents get a clean case history and don‚Äôt need to re-ask the customer everything.


6. Governance & Oversight

Content ownership: who signs off on FAQs and policies.

Offer ownership: who maintains the rules and disclosures.

Monitoring: dashboards for containment rate, satisfaction (CSAT), offer acceptance, and flagged cases.

This way, it‚Äôs not developer-level, but it shows exactly what building blocks need to exist and gives BAs/management a to-do list to line up before the tech team writes a line of code.

Would you like me to drop this in the document draft we worked on earlier, so it flows as a new section?
