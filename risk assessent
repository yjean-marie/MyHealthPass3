Release Risk Assessment & Rollback Strategy
Release 1 – Helios v1 (Jenkins) to Helios v2 (GitHub Actions) Migration
1. Document Purpose

This document outlines the deployment risk, rollback constraints, and mitigation strategies associated with Release 1, scheduled for 20 February 2026, which introduces production deployments using Helios v2 (GitHub Actions) following the decommissioning of Helios v1 (Jenkins) pipelines.

The objective is to:

Clearly articulate the identified risk

Document feasible mitigation options

Define the recovery strategy in the absence of a traditional rollback

Record risk acceptance for governance and audit purposes

2. Release Overview

Release Name: Release 1

Production Date: 20 February 2026

Change Type: CI/CD platform migration (Helios v1 → Helios v2) with functional changes

Deployment Mechanism: Helios v2 (GitHub Actions)

3. In-Scope Components (Release 1)

The following five repositories are included in Release 1 and contain functional changes:

Portal Cloud API

Box Cloud API

Orchestrator Cloud API

Restrain Cloud API

Refresh UI

All components have already been:

Migrated to Helios v2

Successfully deployed and validated in:

Dev

QAT

QAT3

UAT

Pre-Prod

4. Identified Risk
Risk Description

All existing Helios v1 (Jenkins) pipelines for the organisation’s repositories are currently disabled.
As a result, Release 1 production deployments executed via Helios v2 do not have an immediate fallback to Helios v1 in the event of a production issue.

If a critical issue occurs after deployment:

A traditional rollback to the previously deployed production state via Jenkins is not available

Recovery must rely on Helios v2–based rollback or fix-forward remediation

5. Risk Scenario

Release 1 is deployed to production using Helios v2

A blocking or high-severity issue is identified post-deployment

Helios v1 pipelines are unavailable for rollback

The team must:

Roll back using Helios v2, or

Fix forward within the approved change window

Escalate via Emergency Change if remediation exceeds the window

6. Potential Impact

Inability to immediately revert to a previously stable deployment via Jenkins

Increased operational pressure during the change window

Potential service degradation if remediation extends beyond the deployment window

Reliance on emergency change processes if required

7. Risk Assessment

Risk Type: Deployment / Operational Risk

Likelihood: Low–Medium

Impact: High

Overall Risk Rating: Medium–High (prior to mitigation)

8. Mitigation Option 1 – Temporary Re-Enablement of Helios v1 (Jenkins)
Description

Request a temporary exemption to re-enable Helios v1 (Jenkins) pipelines for the five repositories included in Release 1, allowing rollback to the previously deployed production state if required.

This would require:

Formal approval from Monica Brown

Temporary reactivation of Jenkins pipelines for Release 1 scope only

Benefits

Restores a proven rollback mechanism

Minimises production deployment risk for Release 1

Limitations

Exemption approval is uncertain

Not aligned with standard exemption criteria

Additional exemptions would be required for future releases

Not a scalable long-term solution

Residual Risk (If Approved)

Residual Risk: Low

Governance Dependency: High

9. Mitigation Option 2 – Helios v2 Controlled Rollback Strategy (Recommended)
Description

Establish a Helios v2–validated rollback baseline by deploying the current production versions of the affected repositories through Helios v2 to Pre-Prod prior to Release 1, followed by regression testing.

This ensures rollback capability within Helios v2 itself.

9.1 Execution Approach – Release 1 (Five Repositories)

Baseline Deployment

Take the current production versions of the five repositories

Deploy via Helios v2 through all lower environments up to Pre-Prod

Regression Validation

Perform full regression testing in Pre-Prod

Validate functional parity with production

Confirm Helios v2 pipeline stability

Production Deployment

Deploy Release 1 changes to production via Helios v2

Rollback & Recovery

If issues arise:

Roll back to the Helios v2–validated baseline

If rollback deployment fails:

Apply fix-forward remediation

Raise an Emergency Change if remediation exceeds the approved window

9.2 Follow-On Approach – Remaining Five Repositories (Pipeline-Only Change)

Between Release 1 and Release 2, the remaining five repositories will be migrated to Helios v2 without introducing any functional changes.

Execution Steps

Identify the current production versions of the remaining repositories

Convert pipelines to Helios v2

Deploy the unchanged production code via Helios v2 through:

Dev

QAT

QAT3

UAT

Pre-Prod

Perform regression testing and obtain:

Master Test Plan (MTP) sign-off

Required approvals

Deploy the same production versions to production via Helios v2

If issues occur:

Fix forward within the change window

Escalate via Emergency Change if required

10. Residual Risk (Post-Mitigation)

Even with mitigation in place:

Rollback is dependent on Helios v2

If both forward deployment and rollback fail, recovery relies on fix-forward remediation

Emergency Change processes may be required

This residual risk is explicitly acknowledged and accepted as part of the Helios v1 → Helios v2 transition phase.

11. Recommended Approach

Mitigation Option 2 is recommended for Release 1 as it:

Avoids reliance on governance exemptions

Aligns with the long-term CI/CD strategy

Provides a validated rollback mechanism within Helios v2

Scales cleanly to remaining repositories

12. Go-Live Preconditions

Release 1 production deployment is conditional on:

Successful regression testing in Pre-Prod

MTP approval and sign-off

Helios v2 pipeline verification

Change window approval

13. Risk Acceptance

The identified deployment and rollback risks associated with Release 1 are understood and accepted, subject to the mitigation measures outlined in this document and adherence to emergency change procedures if required.
