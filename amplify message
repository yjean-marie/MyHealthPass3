Hey Team,

Just wanted to echo what Monica and Susie have already said â€” huge congratulations to all of you. I know this wasnâ€™t the outcome we were aiming for, but it doesnâ€™t take away from the incredible work, dedication, and creativity youâ€™ve shown throughout Amplify.

You took on challenges head-on that even seasoned RBC enterprise teams would find tough, and you mastered complex technologies in record time. Thatâ€™s no small feat, and it speaks volumes about your talent and adaptability.

Leading you through the dev side of this was a privilege, and I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better crew. Proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished together. ðŸš€

â€” Sherrell

I can also make this even snappier and more conversational for a Teams group post so it really lands quickly. Want me to do that next?
