**Subject**: Update on the After-Screen Issues for Trinidad Existing Customers

Hi Kara,

We have two key points to address:

1. **Blank Field Issue**: There is an issue where fields not covered by Originations are being updated incorrectly, resulting in values being reset to blank (null).
   
2. **Pre-population Issue**: A more critical issue involves correct values for multi-value and regular fields not being pre-populated in this iteration. This leads to inaccurate data being displayed to the client, with fields being overwritten by whatever is entered in the UI and passed to the core APIs.

**Resolution Plan**:
- For **Item 1**, a fix has already been prepared and is ready for deployment to QA for a quick retest.
- For **Item 2**, this concern was flagged and discussed earlier, with awareness of the potential impact of the update functionality working this way. To address this, the development team has proactively implemented an improved solution that ensures values remain unchanged unless explicitly updated. This fix also resolves the multi-value issue, preventing overwriting of correct values. The fix has been unit tested and is ready to proceed, though it will require a bit more testing than **Item 1**.

We would appreciate your approval to proceed with QA testing. Once completed, we can move forward with deployment.

Please also note that UAT for core banking has commenced today.

Best Regards,  
Yuri Jean-Marie
