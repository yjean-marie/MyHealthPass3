Here’s an updated comment that includes your involvement in the GraphQL session as an example:

"As a senior software developer, I contributed to our team’s success by fostering an inclusive, collaborative environment. I engaged regularly with my teammates to share knowledge, provide technical support, and contribute to skill development. For instance, during our GraphQL session, I supported my colleagues in learning and navigating new technologies, encouraging open discussions and knowledge-sharing that helped build our collective expertise.

Throughout projects like the Originations Journey and KYC Refresh, I took a proactive role in offering technical insights, troubleshooting, and sharing best practices on API development and integration. These contributions align with RBC’s values of accountability and continuous learning, helping us achieve our project goals while building a cohesive and empowered team dynamic."

This version ties in your hands-on example from the GraphQL session to reinforce your commitment to team learning and collaboration. Let me know if this aligns with your experience!
