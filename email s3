Certainly! Here's a full, polished version of the email and instructions that you can copy into a Word document and send to the vendor. I've left out the Java snippet and phrased everything to suit both technical and non-technical readers.

Subject: Access to Amazon S3 for Daily Delivery Status Uploads

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. First and foremost, I want to apologize for the delay in getting back to you regarding access. Thank you for your patience.

We now have the credentials ready for you to access the S3 bucket. Please see the instructions below for accessing the bucket manually using Cyberduck. This can be useful for testing or initial validation.

We understand you may prefer to integrate directly via code. While the instructions below focus on manual access, the provided credentials and endpoint are fully compatible with most AWS S3 SDKs and HTTP clients. If you would like a code snippet in your preferred language, we're happy to provide that as well.

Let us know if you have any questions or run into any issues.

Best regards,
Yuri
