Subject: Access to Amazon S3 for Daily Delivery Status Uploads

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. First and foremost, I want to apologize for the delay in getting back to you regarding this access. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding.

Iâ€™m happy to let you know that we now have the credentials ready for you to access the S3 bucket. Our team is also in the process of gathering the necessary information on how to set up the network gateway on your end, as one of our team members has done this before for another vendor. I'll make sure to pass along those details as soon as I have them.

Once again, I apologize for the delay, and thank you for your understanding. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Best regards,
Yuri
