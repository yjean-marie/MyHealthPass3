FinQuest â€“ Gamifying Financial Behaviors for Enhanced Engagement


---

Updated Challenge Description:

FinQuest is a gamified financial management platform designed to encourage positive financial behaviors while driving key banking goals. The platform leverages AI to analyze client activities and generate personalized missions, awarding points for completing challenges such as opening new accounts, keeping KYC up to date, opting for e-statements, and participating in campaign offers. Clients can accumulate points to unlock tiered rewards, including fee waivers, preferential deposit interest rates, and lending discounts.

This solution not only enhances customer engagement and financial literacy but also improves operational efficiency by promoting digital adoption, ensuring timely KYC updates, increasing campaign participation, and boosting debt repayment. Ultimately, FinQuest helps the bank build deeper client relationships, reduce costs, and drive revenue growth.
