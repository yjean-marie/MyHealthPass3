Subject: Clarification on Network Gateway Ticket Approval

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for your follow-up.

Just to clarify, in our earlier message we were actually asking whether an email approval from our Director would be acceptable in this case — since the designated approver is currently on leave and, although I’ve been set as their delegate in Juna, I’m unable to approve the request through the system.

It seems this part may have been missed, so I just wanted to check in again: would a forwarded or attached email showing our Director’s approval be sufficient to meet the approval requirements for audit purposes?

Appreciate your time and guidance on this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like it softened further or if you want to preemptively say you can upload the approval right away if needed.
