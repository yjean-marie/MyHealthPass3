Since this is a new feature added to your existing chatbot POC built using LangChain and ChatGPT, we can frame the slides to highlight how this new feature enhances the original solution.

Here’s an updated structure that incorporates this context:


---

Slide 1: Evolution of the Chatbot POC

This slide introduces the original chatbot POC and highlights the new feature for insights generation.

Title: Enhancing the Chatbot POC: From Conversations to Business Insights

Subtitle: Integrating Data Analysis and SQL Generation to Expand the Chatbot's Capabilities


Key Points to Cover:

1. Recap of the Original POC:

Briefly mention that the original POC focused on building a chatbot using LangChain and ChatGPT to assist users in conversational interactions, answering queries, and other tasks.


Example:

“Our initial chatbot POC was designed to handle general conversational queries and provide intelligent responses.”



2. New Feature: Business Insights from MSSQL:

Explain that the new feature adds the ability to query an MSSQL database and generate business insights from structured data.


Example:

“This new feature allows the chatbot to move beyond conversational queries by accessing the MSSQL database, generating SQL queries, and providing actionable business insights.”



3. How It Fits in the Existing POC:

Show how this feature is seamlessly integrated into the chatbot, expanding its functionality from just answering questions to analyzing structured data.


Example:

“By leveraging the same LangChain and ChatGPT architecture, the chatbot can now interpret business questions, generate SQL queries, and extract insights from databases.”

Slide 2: Demo Workflow and Benefits of the New Feature

This slide will focus on how the new feature works and its advantages.

Title: Business Insight Generation: Demo and Benefits

Subtitle: From Business Queries to Data-Driven Insights


Key Points to Cover:

1. Demo Workflow (New Feature in Action):

Step 1: User Input – A business user interacts with the chatbot and asks for insights like “Show me the customer trends for flagged KYC accounts.”

Step 2: SQL Query Generation – The chatbot (via LangChain) generates an SQL query based on the user’s question.

Step 3: SQL Execution and Data Summarization – The SQL is executed on an MSSQL database, and the chatbot summarizes the results.

Step 4: Business Insights – ChatGPT generates higher-level insights based on the results, such as “Flagged accounts in Region X are increasing, especially among new customers.”



2. Screenshots:

Show a simple flow with screenshots from the chatbot interaction:

3. Key Benefits:

Enhanced Chatbot Capabilities: “The chatbot is now capable of accessing structured data and deriving insights from it, beyond just conversational responses.”

Real-Time Business Insights: “Users can get real-time insights from the database without writing SQL queries themselves.”

Efficient Decision-Making: “The chatbot helps users quickly analyze and interpret data, enabling better business decisions.”

Integration with Existing Architecture: “This feature leverages the same LangChain and ChatGPT architecture, minimizing additional setup or resources.”



4. How It Complements the Chatbot:

The new feature extends the use case of the chatbot beyond simple Q&A, allowing it to support data-driven decision-making.


Example:

“This enhancement takes the chatbot beyond conversations into the realm of business intelligence, enabling users to extract real-time insights directly from their data.”

Here’s a workflow diagram for your presentation, which visually demonstrates the integration of the new MSSQL insight generation feature into your existing LangChain & ChatGPT chatbot POC.

You can use this description to build a diagram, or I can describe it in a way that can be directly illustrated.


---

Workflow for the Diagram:

Step 1: User Interaction (Chatbot Frontend)

Description: The user starts by interacting with the chatbot via a text-based interface, asking a business-related question like, “What are the customer trends for flagged KYC accounts?”

Action: The chatbot captures the natural language query.


Step 2: LangChain Query Interpretation

Description: The chatbot sends the user’s input to LangChain.

Action: LangChain interprets the input and identifies that it is a request to extract data from an MSSQL database.

Example: The system identifies that the query relates to KYC data, customer trends, and flagged accounts.


Step 3: SQL Query Generation (LangChain)

Description: LangChain generates an SQL query based on the interpreted input.

Action: It formulates the SQL query by considering the database schema and translating the natural language input into a structured SQL query.

Example:

SELECT customer_type, region, COUNT(*) as flagged_count
FROM kyc_table
WHERE flagged = 1
GROUP BY customer_type, region;


Step 4: Query Execution on MSSQL Database

Description: The generated SQL query is sent to the MSSQL database for execution.

Action: The MSSQL database processes the query and returns the raw data based on the customer trends for flagged accounts.


Step 5: Data Summarization

Description: After the data is retrieved, a summarization layer (in Python or directly within the system) processes the results.

Action: This layer aggregates the data and extracts key statistics (e.g., customer trends, flagged regions, risk factors).

Example: Summarize the number of flagged accounts by customer type and region.


Step 6: Business Insight Generation (ChatGPT)

Description: The summarized data is then passed to ChatGPT, which analyzes the results and provides business-level conclusions.

Action: ChatGPT reasons about the data and generates insights based on patterns or anomalies.

Example Insight:
“Most flagged accounts come from Region X, especially among small businesses. This indicates a potential risk area for further investigation.”


Step 7: Response Back to the User

Description: The final insights are formatted into a response and sent back to the user via the chatbot interface.

Action: The user receives actionable business insights directly from the chatbot without having to deal with raw SQL data or write any queries.

Example Response:
“In Region X, flagged accounts are primarily small businesses. These accounts make up 60% of the total flagged accounts in the last quarter.”
