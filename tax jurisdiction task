Got it! Here's an example of a JIRA task with Gherkin acceptance criteria to cover this defect:

Task Title: Handle Empty Tax Jurisdiction for US in API Integration with RIBS

Description: This task addresses a defect where, if the Alpha 2 ISO code for a tax jurisdiction is 'US,' the corresponding jurisdiction and TIN fields are set to empty. When multiple tax jurisdictions are passed, this leaves the first jurisdiction blank, causing a misalignment in subsequent jurisdictions when sent to the RIBS system.

The solution will ensure that if a US jurisdiction is set to empty, the next tax jurisdiction fills the position, preventing any blank lines in the core banking system.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Given the API accepts a list of tax jurisdictions
When the list contains a tax jurisdiction with the Alpha 2 ISO code 'US'
Then the Alpha code and TIN number for 'US' should be set to empty

Scenario: Tax jurisdiction list contains multiple jurisdictions, including 'US'
Given the API receives a list of tax jurisdictions with 'US' as the first jurisdiction
When the US jurisdiction is set to empty
Then the next jurisdiction in the list should fill the position in the RIBS system
And no blank lines should appear between jurisdictions in the system

Scenario: Tax jurisdiction 'US' appears in a non-first position
Given the API receives a list of tax jurisdictions where 'US' is not the first jurisdiction
When the US jurisdiction is set to empty
Then the previous and subsequent jurisdictions should maintain their correct positions in the system
And no blank lines should be sent to the RIBS system

This should cover the defect and ensure the correct handling of the empty US jurisdiction. Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything.
