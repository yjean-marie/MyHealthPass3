Ah — got it. Thanks for the clarification. You're saying:

> The Schedule Job API is its own component, and needs to be tested independently of the Notification APIs. So the user stories should now be written from the perspective of the Job API itself, not how other apps use it.



Perfect. Here's the restructured, clean set of stories for the Schedule Job API as a standalone component.


---

Story 1: Create Job Entry

Title: Create Job Entry via API

Description:
As a client of the Schedule Job API,
I want to create a new job record,
So that I can begin tracking the lifecycle of a scheduled job.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Successful job creation
  Given valid job metadata is provided
  When a POST request is made to /jobs
  Then a new job should be created in the database
  And the response should contain the jobId and status STARTED

Scenario: Missing required fields
  Given an incomplete request payload
  When the API is called
  Then a 400 Bad Request should be returned with a validation message

Implementation Notes:

Endpoint: POST /jobs

Required fields: jobName, jobType, environment, status

Defaults: createDatetime set to current timestamp

Returns: generated jobId, initial status



---

Story 2: Update Job Status

Title: Update Job Status via API

Description:
As a user of the Job API,
I want to update the job’s status throughout its lifecycle,
So that the system can track its current progress or failure state.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Update job to IN_PROGRESS
  Given a job exists
  When a PUT request is made with status IN_PROGRESS
  Then the job's status should be updated in the database

Scenario: Mark job as FAILED
  Given a failure occurs
  When a PUT request is made with status FAILED and failure details
  Then the job should be updated accordingly with failure code/message

Scenario: Retry count increment
  Given a job is retried
  When a PUT request is made with an incremented retry count
  Then the retry_count field should reflect the new value

Implementation Notes:

Endpoint: PUT /jobs/{jobId}

Optional fields: retryCount, failureCode, failureMessage, summary, updatedDatetime

Only mutable fields should be updateable



---

Story 3: Retrieve Job by ID

Title: Retrieve Job Details

Description:
As a monitoring tool or polling service,
I want to retrieve the full job metadata using a job ID,
So I can confirm job completion or monitor its progress.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Fetch job by ID
  Given a valid jobId
  When a GET request is made to /jobs/{jobId}
  Then the full job record should be returned

Scenario: Invalid job ID
  Given a jobId that does not exist
  When the API is queried
  Then a 404 Not Found should be returned

Implementation Notes:

Endpoint: GET /jobs/{jobId}

Should return all fields in the job entity

Must include error response structure for invalid IDs



---

Story 4: Secure API Access with Bearer Token

Title: Secure Schedule Job API

Description:
As an admin,
I want all endpoints of the Job API to be protected by Bearer Token authentication,
So that only authorized services can use it.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Valid token access
  Given a valid bearer token is sent in the header
  When the API is called
  Then the request should be allowed

Scenario: Missing or invalid token
  When a request is made without a token or with an invalid token
  Then a 401 Unauthorized response should be returned

Implementation Notes:

Use Spring Security

Bearer token stored in Vault

Token validation filter to check Authorization header on every request



---

Story 5: Handle Job Retries with Parent Reference

Title: Store Retry Chains via Parent Job ID

Description:
As a system handling retries,
I want to link a retry job to the original job via parent_job_id,
So I can trace retry relationships.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Create a retry job with parent reference
  Given a failed job ID
  When a new job is created with parentJobId
  Then the system should store the relationship correctly

Implementation Notes:

parentJobId is optional during job creation

Enables retry tracking and lineage analysis

One-to-many relationship (a job can have many retries)



---

Story 6: Implement Global Exception Handling

Title: Global Error Handling

Description:
As a user of the Job API,
I want to receive consistent error responses,
So that I can handle failures gracefully in clients.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Missing fields
  Given required fields are not provided
  Then the API should return HTTP 400 with a clear validation message

Scenario: Unhandled exception
  Given an unexpected error occurs
  Then the API should return a 500 response with a standard format

Implementation Notes:

Use @ControllerAdvice

Include timestamp, error message, status code in all error responses

Useful for frontend or automated clients



---

Story 7: Add Swagger Documentation

Title: Expose API Documentation via Swagger

Description:
As a developer integrating with the Job API,
I want to view all available endpoints in Swagger UI,
So that I can understand how to consume them.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Scenario: Swagger UI loads
  When I navigate to /swagger-ui.html
  Then I should see documentation for all Job API endpoints

Implementation Notes:

Use SpringDoc OpenAPI

Include operation summaries, request/response models

Hosted at /swagger-ui.html

Would you like me to generate this into a downloadable CSV or Word document next?
