Got it. Here’s a business-analyst friendly version—clear, jargon-lite, and focused on outcomes and governance.

What we’re building (in plain English)

An AI Help & Offers Assistant for the banking call/chat channel that:

1. Solves common customer problems by looking up the right steps in our approved documents (RAG = “retrieve, then answer”).


2. Then suggests an eligible product or offer (only if the customer consents and meets rules), written in friendly language.


3. Hands off to a human smoothly when the question is sensitive or the answer isn’t clear.



Think of it as one assistant with two “modes”: Help first → (maybe) Offer.

Why this matters (business value)

Shorter handle time and higher first-contact resolution on FAQs.

Consistent answers (quotes the exact policy/version).

Revenue lift via next-best-offer when appropriate and compliant.

Better customer experience: less waiting, clear steps, easy handoff.


Customer journey (what the client sees)

1. Greets & understands the issue.


2. Finds the exact steps from our internal help docs and shows them with a short checklist and a “Source: Policy XYZ (effective date)”.


3. Checks if resolved. If not, it summarizes the case and connects to an agent.


4. If resolved and the customer agrees, it presents one relevant offer (e.g., fee waiver upgrade, credit card pre-approval) with key facts and disclosures.


5. Saves the interaction (for quality, audit, and learning).



What’s under the hood (no code, just roles)

Knowledge Base (KB): Approved FAQs, procedures, policy PDFs.

Retrieval (the “R” in RAG): Finds the most relevant snippets from the KB based on the user’s question.

Answering (the “G” in RAG): Writes a clear, step-by-step answer using only those snippets and shows the source.

Offer Engine: Separate rules service that decides which offer is allowed (eligibility, consent, risk). The AI only explains that offer; it does not decide eligibility.

Handoff: Sends a short summary and context to a human agent.


Data, privacy, and controls (bank-ready)

No raw statements or IDs are stored in the KB.

Consent gate before any offer.

Jurisdiction filters (e.g., TT vs. BB) so fees/terms match the customer’s location.

Sensitive topics auto-handoff (lost card, suspected fraud, KYC status).

Versioned answers (“effective as of YYYY-MM-DD”).

Full audit trail (what content was used, what offer was shown, why).


What BAs will manage

Content lifecycle: which articles are in scope, owners, review dates, effective dates.

Answer quality rules: tone, reading level, mandatory disclaimers, required steps.

Eligibility & offer rules (with Product/Legal): which attributes matter, what to exclude, fairness checks.

Routing rules: when to hand off to agents, and what summary fields are required.

Metrics reviews: weekly dashboards, A/B test results, exceptions.


Metrics we’ll track

Containment rate (solved without agent).

First-contact resolution and Average handle time.

Groundedness (answers cite approved docs).

CSAT for helped customers.

Offer acceptance rate (and opt-outs).

Escalation appropriateness (false handoffs).


Rollout plan (phased, low-risk)

Phase 1 (2–3 weeks):

Top 50 FAQs, one country, one product line.

Answers with citations; no offers yet.

BA sign-off workflow and weekly quality review.


Phase 2 (2–3 weeks):

Add one simple, fully compliant offer via the Offer Engine (e.g., card upgrade).

Consent prompt, disclosures, and audit logging.

A/B test answer formats (checklists vs paragraphs).


Phase 3:

More products, more countries, richer routing (live chat, email follow-ups), multilingual.


Example interaction (condensed)

Client: “My online transfer keeps failing.”
Assistant: “Let’s fix that. Here are the steps… (1–2–3). Source: ‘Digital Transfers Policy’, effective 2025-06-01.”
Assistant: “Did that solve it?”
Client: “Yes.”
Assistant: “Would you like to see a no-annual-fee card that increases your daily transfer limit? (Learn more)”
Client: “Sure.”
Assistant: “Here’s the summary, benefits, and required disclosures. You can apply now or later.”

Risks & how we mitigate

Wrong/outdated guidance → Versioned content, citations, BA review workflow.

Privacy concerns → Consent gate, no PII in the KB, minimal data to the AI.

Over-marketing → “Help-first” rule, strict eligibility, offer frequency caps.

Regulatory variance by island → Jurisdiction tags and filters in retrieval.


Operating model (who does what)

BAs: curate articles, define answer templates, review metrics, adjust flows.

Product/Legal/Compliance: approve content and offers; set disclosures.

Tech: maintain the assistant, retrieval index, Offer Engine, and dashboards.

Ops/Contact Center: define handoff triggers and summary fields.


Quick glossary

RAG: Retrieve from our docs → Generate an answer that only uses those docs.

Offer Engine: Rules system that returns eligible offers (AI just words it nicely).

Grounded answer: One that cites its sources and matches policy wording.

If you’d like, I can convert this into a one-pager and a slide with a simple diagram for stakeholders (Help → Resolve → (Consent) Offer → Handoff), plus a checklist BAs can use for content sign-off.
