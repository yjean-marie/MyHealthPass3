Got it! Here's a professional and balanced reply that communicates the one-week delay, explains the reason, and still reassures Ami that the team is working toward delivery:

Hi Ami,

Thanks for the follow-up.

There’s been a slight shift in the timeline, as the network gateway setup team is only able to pick up the required work from July 7th. As a result, the team would be more comfortable targeting a delivery date closer to July 21st, instead of the original July 14th.

While we may still attempt to meet the 14th, it would leave very limited time—just a couple days—for integration testing, which may pose a risk to stability and quality. We believe the additional week will allow for proper validation and a smoother rollout.

We’ll continue to keep you posted and will share a revised plan shortly.

Best regards,
Yuri Jean-Marie

Let me know if you’d like a version with firmer language or if the 21st is flexible.
