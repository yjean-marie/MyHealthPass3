Excellent catch — you’re right. They specifically asked for:
1️⃣ What changes were made,
2️⃣ The impact, and
3️⃣ PIV (Post Implementation Validation) results.

Let’s make sure your reply clearly answers each of those while still emphasizing that it was a configuration-only fix, no functional code changes, and tested successfully.

Here’s a refined draft you can send:

Subject: Re: Clarification on Configuration Update – October 1

Dear [Name/Team],

Please see below details regarding the October 1 production update:

Change Made:
A non-functional configuration update was applied to increase the internal memory buffer limit used by the application when processing large API responses from the GraphQL service. This change was necessary to prevent system errors encountered during deployment due to the larger size of live production data.

Reason / Context:
The issue was not observed in lower environments because the masked datasets used for testing contain shorter, template-based values, whereas production data includes longer and more variable text fields. This resulted in larger payloads in production that exceeded the default configuration limit.

Impact:

No business or functional logic was modified.

The change was purely configuration-based and only affects how the system handles large payloads internally.

Without this adjustment, the deployment would have failed when processing live data.


PIV Results:
Post-deployment validation confirmed the following:

Application and API calls are functioning as expected.

Data retrieval and refresh processes are stable.

No anomalies or regressions were detected following the configuration change.


We are continuing to investigate the observation noted by Rajesh and Viraj regarding the restraint table separately, as it appears unrelated to this configuration update.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title / Team]

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter version of this (for sending in a reply thread) and a slightly more detailed one (for attachment or documentation)?
