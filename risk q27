Q26 – Procedures for Reviewing/Escalating Anomalous Access

> "Are there established procedures being used to review, escalate anomalous access to data by RBC or third-party employees? When were procedures last reviewed and approved?"

What they’re asking

They want to know if there are formal, documented procedures that say:

1. How anomalous access to sensitive data is identified.


2. Who reviews it (app team, SOC, InfoSec, Risk).


3. How it’s escalated (incident tickets, FIRE Call ID, management notification).


4. When those procedures were last reviewed and approved (so they aren’t stale).



This is about formal governance — not just “we could do it if it happened.”

From what you’ve told me so far

Detection/Monitoring: App logs user activity inconsistently; SOC/monitoring teams can investigate when incidents are raised. ✅

Escalation Path: You already have a process — incidents → FIRE Call ID → Production Support/SOC investigate. ✅

Documentation: You’ve said earlier there’s no formal documented procedure for suspicious security activity (only for operational errors). ❌

Review/Approval Date: Since no doc exists, you wouldn’t have a “last reviewed” date. ❌

Expert Answer (Q26)

Answer:
No formal documented procedure currently exists at the application level for reviewing or escalating anomalous access to data by RBC or third-party employees. In practice, anomalies would be handled through the enterprise Incident Management process: suspicious activity is raised as an incident, escalated via a FIRE Call ID, and investigated by the Production Support Team with escalation to SOC/Information Security as required.

There is no record of a last review/approval date for a specific anomalous access procedure for this application.

Expert Note: It is recommended that a documented procedure specific to anomalous access investigations be developed, aligned with enterprise security policies, and formally reviewed/approved on a recurring basis (e.g., annually).

Summary (for sheet cell)

No – No formal documented procedure. Escalation occurs via Incident Management process (FIRE Call ID). No last review/approval date available.

👉 Do you want me to help you draft a short “gap-closing procedure” template for anomalous access (like we did for the risk acceptance doc), so if RISC presses you, you can show you’re already working on formalizing it?
