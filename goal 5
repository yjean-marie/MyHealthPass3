Goal: Talent

Objective: Create strong relationships with Caribbean business leaders and be a thought leader and trusted partner for them. Continue to shift towards agility and software development efficiency through active learning, cross-training, and early completion of development plans and mandatory courses.

My Feedback:
I had the opportunity to participate in a roundtable session with Monica, which provided valuable exposure to leadership perspectives and alignment with RBC Caribbean’s technology strategy.
While I did not have formal mentoring assignments this cycle, I contributed to team discussions and technical decision-making through my technical lead role on the Amplify team, helping guide the design and implementation of the Agentic KYC solution.
From a development standpoint, I completed all required RBC learning and development courses within the set timelines and began exploring a MongoDB course to expand my technical depth, which remains in progress.
Overall, I maintained consistent collaboration with peers and leadership, supported cross-team efficiency, and demonstrated a commitment to ongoing learning and professional growth.

Rationale:

Participated in leadership roundtable with Monica.

Served as technical lead on the Amplify initiative.

Completed all mandatory RBC courses within required timelines.

Would you like me to now help you write a summary paragraph that ties all your goals together (for the “Overall Comments” or “Summary of Accomplishments” box at the bottom of the review)? It’s the final section that usually wraps everything into one cohesive story.
