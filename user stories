Here’s how you can outline the two tasks using Gherkin language for acceptance criteria:

### Task 1: Modify the Co-Agnostic Layer to Accept a Comma-Separated List of Keys

**Title:** Modify Co-Agnostic Layer to Accept Comma-Separated Keys for Factor Document

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Co-Agnostic Layer receives a request with a single field for Factor Document,  
**And** the request contains a comma-separated list of keys (e.g., "02,03,04"),  
**When** the request is processed,  
**Then** the system should split the comma-separated list of keys,  
**And** generate a list of Factor Document objects,  
**And** each Factor Document should have the key field populated according to the corresponding value in the comma-separated list,  
**And** the other two fields in Factor Document should remain unused.

### Task 2: Future Implementation to Accept a List of Factor Documents

**Title:** Update Co-Agnostic Layer to Accept a List of Factor Documents

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Co-Agnostic Layer receives a request containing a list of Factor Documents,  
**When** the request is processed,  
**Then** the system should accept and correctly parse the list of Factor Document objects,  
**And** each Factor Document should be fully populated according to the data provided in the list,  
**And** the system should handle multiple Factor Documents according to the requirements specified in the interface.

These tasks should help guide the implementation and ensure that the modifications and future changes are properly documented and tested.



Here’s how you can outline the task with the specifics included:

### Task: Modify Occupation Logic to Check 'School Name' Field Instead of Occupation Key

**Title:** Update Occupation Logic to Use 'School Name' for Validation in Co-Agnostic Layer

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Co-Agnostic Layer processes a request where the occupation field contains both a key and a value,  
**And** the key was previously checked against an enum to determine if the person was a student or retired,  
**And** the system received text instead of an integer for the occupation key,  
**When** the request is processed,  
**Then** the system should no longer check the occupation key against the enum,  
**And** the system should instead check if the 'school name' field is filled,  
**And** if the 'school name' field is filled, the system should proceed with the necessary logic,  
**And** the logic should work consistently without relying on the occupation key being an integer.

This description captures the detailed change you made, ensuring the logic is correctly documented and understood for future reference.


Here’s how you can outline the task for the postal code bug fix:

### Task: Remove Required Annotation from Postal Code Field

**Title:** Bug Fix: Remove Required Annotation from Postal Code Field in Co-Agnostic Layer

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Co-Agnostic Layer processes a request containing a postal code field,  
**And** the postal code field was previously marked as required,  
**When** the request is processed,  
**Then** the system should no longer enforce the postal code as a required field,  
**And** the 'required' annotation should be removed from the postal code field in the codebase,  
**And** the system should accept requests without a postal code without throwing validation errors.

This task outlines the simple but critical fix you made, ensuring the postal code field behaves as expected.






Certainly! Here’s a draft of the task along with the acceptance criteria:

**Task Title:**  
Update API to Translate 400 Status Code to 401 for Insufficient Privileges Error

**Task Description:**  
Currently, one of the core systems in our mid-tier co-agnostic solution returns a `400 Bad Request` status code for cases where a user has insufficient privileges, which should correctly be returning a `401 Unauthorized` status code. This task involves implementing a translation layer in our mid-tier solution that will intercept responses from the core system. When the error text indicates "not sufficient privileges," the system should update the HTTP status code from `400` to `401` before returning it to the client.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Error Interception:**  
   - The mid-tier solution intercepts any `400 Bad Request` responses from the core system.

2. **Text Check:**  
   - The system checks if the error message text contains or equals "not sufficient privileges."

3. **Status Code Update:**  
   - If the error text matches the condition above, the mid-tier solution updates the status code from `400 Bad Request` to `401 Unauthorized`.

4. **Response Integrity:**  
   - All other parts of the response (headers, body, etc.) remain unchanged except for the status code.

5. **Logging:**  
   - Appropriate logging is in place to record when a status code is translated from `400` to `401` for this specific scenario.

6. **Unit Tests:**  
   - Unit tests are created to ensure that:
     - A `400` response with the error text "not sufficient privileges" is correctly translated to `401`.
     - A `400` response with different error texts is not altered.
     - No other status codes are affected by this change.

7. **End-to-End Testing:**  
   - Conduct end-to-end tests to validate the functionality by simulating a scenario where the core system returns a `400` due to insufficient privileges, ensuring the client receives a `401` instead.

Does this align with what you're looking for, or would you like to make any adjustments?


Certainly! Here’s the acceptance criteria written in Gherkin:

```gherkin
Feature: Translate 400 Status Code to 401 for Insufficient Privileges Error

  Scenario: Core system returns 400 with "not sufficient privileges" error text
    Given the core system returns a 400 Bad Request status code
    And the error message text contains "not sufficient privileges"
    When the mid-tier system processes the response
    Then the status code is updated from 400 Bad Request to 401 Unauthorized
    And the response body and headers remain unchanged
    And a log entry is created indicating the status code translation

  Scenario: Core system returns 400 with a different error text
    Given the core system returns a 400 Bad Request status code
    And the error message text does not contain "not sufficient privileges"
    When the mid-tier system processes the response
    Then the status code remains 400 Bad Request
    And the response body and headers remain unchanged

  Scenario: Core system returns a status code other than 400
    Given the core system returns a status code other than 400
    When the mid-tier system processes the response
    Then the status code is not altered
    And the response body and headers remain unchanged
```

This Gherkin language should help in clearly defining the behavior of the system when processing different scenarios. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
