Perfect — thanks for catching that. Here’s the revised version of your feedback with the correct project references (Feature 5, Feature 4, and SMS) and your progress wording kept exact and clear:

Goal: Best-in-Class Digital Business

Objective: Increase Helios adoption by moving all eligible apps to Helios 2.0 (GitHub Actions). Onboard all new app features and code through Helios 2.0 and conduct all PRs/reviews via the new interface.

My Feedback:
There are 16 repositories under my team’s scope — 2 CI-only and 14 full CI/CD. Both CI-only pipelines were fully migrated to Helios 2.0 in October, ahead of schedule.
Migration of the 14 CI/CD pipelines is in progress and remains on track to meet the November 26–28 deadline.
Focus temporarily shifted to deliver major KYC features (Feature 5, Feature 4, and SMS) to meet production commitments, but Helios adoption work continued in parallel.
All new pull requests and code reviews are now routed through Helios 2.0, strengthening transparency, governance, and build quality across services.

Self-Rating: ⚙️ Partially Met (Progress on Track)
Rationale:

2 / 16 repositories (CI-only) fully migrated.

14 / 16 CI/CD migrations underway; on track for November completion.

PR and review process fully transitioned to Helios 2.0.

Focus on Feature 5, Feature 4, and SMS deliverables temporarily affected migration sequence but not target completion.
