Here’s a shorter, WebEx-friendly version of that message:

Hey team — quick summary on the notification issue:

The Notification page pulls UUIDs from notice_transaction_master, then calls the Client API for client profiles. The Client API uses the latest run date (from SELECT MAX(run_date) in OPS DB).

Right now, a few client records were updated to Oct 7–8, but most are still Oct 6. Because the max run date is Oct 8, the Client API only returns those few Oct 8 records — so the UI shows a count but no records.

To fix it, we can either:
1️⃣ Revert the Oct 7–8 records back to Oct 6, or
2️⃣ Update all Oct 6 records (test data) to Oct 8.

Either way will unblock testing. Which option do we prefer?

Would you like me to make it sound slightly more casual (for chat flow) or keep it crisp like this?
