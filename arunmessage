Got it 👍 — here’s the revised short message (like the one I gave you earlier, but now with the overwrite risk included). This works well for Teams/Webex chat:

Short Message to Arun:

Hey Arun, quick summary on the scheduled client notices issue:

Old behavior → query OPSDB; if no data for the current run date, the job fails.

New behavior → via Client API (Akil’s service). If no run date is passed, it defaults to the last run date.

Right now, we’re not passing the current run date, so the job picks up old data instead of failing.


Impact:

1. Breaks A/B test alignment with the old flow.


2. Risk that stale data could overwrite current/valid data in the notices table.



Action: I think we should explicitly pass the current run date into the Client API. Can you confirm this is the right adjustment or share context in stand-up today?

Do you want me to also trim this into one flowing paragraph (instead of bullets) so it feels even more natural in Webex?
