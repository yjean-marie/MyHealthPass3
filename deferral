Subject: Deferral of 2026 RBC Performance Conference Attendance

Dear RBC Performance Conference Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to confirm that I have submitted my deferral request online for the upcoming 2026 Performance Conference scheduled for January 10, 2026. Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend this year’s event as my wife is expecting our baby girl in late November, and I will still be on paternity leave at that time. It has been a challenging pregnancy, and I will be providing additional support during that period.

A secondary factor is that I do not currently hold a U.S. visa, which would make travel difficult.

I remain deeply honoured by the recognition and opportunity to attend the Performance Conference and would be grateful to be considered for participation in the 2027 conference instead.

Thank you for your understanding, and please let me know if any additional information is required to complete the deferral process.

Warm regards,
Sherrell Jean-Marie
Senior Software Developer, RBC Caribbean

Would you like me to make it sound a little more personal and conversational (still professional but more human), or keep it in this formal business tone?
