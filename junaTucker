Subject: Request for Assistance: Network Gateway Access Ticket on Juna

Dear Adrian,

I hope you're well.

We’ve submitted a ticket on Juna requesting Network Gateway Access, but unfortunately, the assigned approver is currently on leave. Although I’ve been set as his delegate, Juna doesn’t appear to be allowing me to approve the request either.

Would it be acceptable to attach an email approval from our director to the ticket, so that you or your team can proceed with the necessary work? Please let me know if that would suffice or if there’s another route you’d prefer us to take.

Thanks in advance for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like it to sound more casual or if you want to include the ticket number directly.
