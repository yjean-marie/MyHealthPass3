Sure, here's a more polished and thoughtful version of your message that still sounds like you, but adds some depth and clarity:

Hey Sagar,
Meant to ask you this earlier—do you think there’s any chance of nominating Akil and Iwan for a quarterly award?

Honestly, I was really impressed with the work they did on the GraphQL Client API. From the initial requirements gathering all the way through to production, they handled the entire process with a level of ownership and efficiency that really stood out. The API had a direct and meaningful impact on the KYC project—speeding things up, simplifying the integration, and reducing back-and-forth significantly.

They were proactive, responsive, and got it delivered in record time without compromising quality. Just solid execution across the board.

Let me know what you think.


Got it—thanks for clarifying. So the Client API is already live in production, but the KYC team hasn't started using it in production yet. Here's a revised version of the message with that nuance included and still keeping it informal:

The Client API is already live in production, and I know we probably need to wait until KYC starts using it in production before anything official can happen, but I was thinking once we roll out CTF-5, it might be a good time to consider it.

They did an excellent job on that GraphQL Client API—handled everything from gathering the requirements to delivery and post-deployment support. It was a solid build that had a real impact on the KYC project. The turnaround time, the quality of the work, and how they pushed it through to prod quickly—it really stood out.

Just thought I’d bring it up now so it’s on the radar.

Let me know if you want to tailor it even more for a particular tone or platform.

Would you like it even more informal or should I add anything specific like dates, performance metrics, or stakeholder feedback?
