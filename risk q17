Detailed Answer (Q17 ‚Äì Audit Log Levels)

Answer:
Partially. Audit logging is in place but not consistently detailed enough to fully support forensic investigations.

Application Logs: User identifiers and timestamps are captured for user actions and stored in audit log tables. However, detail is inconsistent across events, and request/response payloads are not logged.

Database Logs: SQL Server audit logging is not enabled.

Infrastructure Logs: OCP/Stonebranch logs are captured and centralized into Elastic/Kibana and Splunk via Logging-as-a-Service. These provide visibility into platform and job activities but are not always tied to individual users.

Retention: Logs are retained according to enterprise Logging-as-a-Service policy, which ensures availability for investigation within defined periods.


Expert Note: To strengthen forensic readiness, enabling SQL Server audit logging, enforcing consistent user identifier capture across all application logs, and confirming enterprise log retention SLAs are recommended.

Summary (for the sheet cell)

Other ‚Äì Audit logs exist (user IDs, timestamps, infra logs via Kibana/Splunk), but SQL audit logging is disabled and user-level detail is inconsistent. Retention managed under enterprise Logging-as-a-Service.
