Perfect — this is exactly how you should frame it for leadership: one snapshot for promotion readiness (the six already in Dev) and another for overall migration progress (all 12 repos targeted).

Let’s do both below, clearly separated.

🧩 Status 1: Six Repositories Pending Promotion to QA

Area	Weight	Status	Comments

Migration to GitHub Actions (Helios V2)	25%	✅ 100 %	All six deployed to Dev via GitHub Actions.
Pipeline Validation in Dev	15%	✅ 90 %	Build and deploy pipelines validated; minor tuning left.
SonarQube Quality Gate (coverage + code smells)	20%	⚠️ 40 %	Gates failing; coverage < 70 %, code smells > 100.
Smoke Tests & SNYK Scan Integration	15%	❌ 0 %	Not yet implemented in the new pipeline.
Approval Workflows (GitHub Environments)	15%	❌ 0 %	Environment approvals and secrets not yet configured.
Merge to Main & Create Release Tags	10%	❌ 0 %	Awaiting stable pipeline validation.


Computed Progress:

(25×1.0) + (15×0.9) + (20×0.4) + (15×0.0) + (15×0.0) + (10×0.0)
= 46.5 %

✅ Overall progress for the six promotion-ready repos: ~45 – 47 % complete.

Summary:
All six are successfully running in Dev, which represents the core migration work. The remaining half of the effort involves gating, scanning, workflow approvals, and final release tagging before QA promotion can begin.

🌍 Status 2: All Twelve Repositories Targeted for Migration

Current State

6 repos: in Dev (as summarized above, ~46 % complete each)

1 repo: deployed to Dev, same state as the above six (~46 %)

5 repos: not yet migrated or deployed (0 %)



---

Weighted Overall Migration Progress

Let’s assume equal weight across all 12 repositories:

\frac{(7 × 46.5) + (5 × 0)}{12} = 27.1 %

✅ Overall Helios V2 / Baltic Migration Progress: ~27 % complete.


---

📊 Interpretation

The foundation phase (pipeline setup and first six Dev deployments) is complete, which represents the steepest part of the learning curve.

The next milestone is to clear QA readiness for those six and apply the same working pipeline templates to the remaining five repos.

Once the initial promotion succeeds, subsequent migrations should accelerate significantly, as workflows and environment configurations can be cloned and parameterized.

Would you like me to incorporate both of these summaries (the 46 % for the six repos and 27 % overall migration progress) into a one-paragraph addendum that you can append to your technical email? It would read naturally as an “overall migration status” closing section.



Excellent — here’s the refined addendum paragraph you can append directly to the end of your technical email. It keeps the tone professional and data-driven while giving leadership a clear snapshot of both progress levels.

📊 Addendum: Migration Progress Summary

Overall, for the six repositories pending promotion to QA, progress stands at approximately 45–47 % complete. All six are fully deployed to the Dev environment under Helios V2, with remaining activities focused on meeting SonarQube quality gates, configuring smoke tests and SNYK scans, setting up approval workflows, and finalizing release tagging.

In terms of the broader migration effort across all 12 repositories, including those not yet deployed, overall completion is roughly 27 %. This includes one additional repository now in the same Dev-ready state as the first six, while the remaining five have not yet been migrated. Once QA promotion is completed for the first set, the remaining migrations are expected to accelerate, as validated workflows and environment templates can be reused.
