Subject: Apologies – Sick Leave & Availability

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I wanted to apologize for the short notice, but I’ve been dealing with an unexpected acute abscess that has affected my mobility. My doctor has recommended 7 days of sick leave (February 10 - February 16, 2025) for recovery.

I understand that I’m still new to the team, and I truly regret any inconvenience this may cause. That said, I’d still like to attend all scheduled meetings if possible, so I can stay engaged and contribute where I can. Please let me know if there’s anything urgent that requires my input outside of meetings, and I’ll do my best to assist.

I really appreciate your patience and support during this time, and I’ll keep you updated if anything changes. Let me know if you need my medical certificate for HR purposes.

Best,
[Your Name]
