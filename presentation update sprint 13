You're absolutely right — if you go with a title like "Testing, Tuning & Transition", the slide content should visibly support that theme to feel cohesive. Let’s revise the structure and wording of the slide so that each section mirrors the title components:


---

🧪 Testing, Tuning & Transition

🧪 Testing

Unit testing completed for all six refactored Client Notification Jobs.

Verified integration with the Client API and the notice_transaction table.

Bugs identified during testing were quickly resolved in collaboration with QA.


🎛️ Tuning

Dedicated ~50% of sprint capacity to supporting SMS job testing.

Actively captured and responded to emerging requirements during QA testing cycles.

Fine-tuned job behavior to match real-world expectations and edge cases.


🔁 Transition

Coordinated release preparation and validation for:

SMS Job Deployment

Stonebranch Workflow Integration


Finalized job readiness for production deployment.

💬 Presentation Script (Revised)

> “This sprint was a transition point — after optimizing the jobs, we moved into testing, tuning, and preparing them for release.

Under ‘testing’, we completed unit tests for all six client notification jobs. We ensured the integrations were clean and any bugs were resolved collaboratively with QA.

For ‘tuning’, a good chunk of our sprint was spent supporting the SMS testing efforts — not just bug fixes but also helping clarify and lock down any extra requirements.

And finally, under ‘transition’, we supported releases for both the SMS job and the Stonebranch deployment, ensuring everything was lined up for production. This closes out the sprint with a solid handoff.”
