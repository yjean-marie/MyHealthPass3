Quick Update:

The issue Rajesh encountered during testing stems from a recent Helios configuration change. Based on Komad’s recommendation, we marked develop-2024 as a release branch. As a result, deployments are now being pushed to the main route in OCP.

With this deployment request, our QAC environment will contain production code only, while UAC—pending approval of the request—will host the develop-2024 code.

That said, this setup is not ideal for our workflow. I'm currently working with Komad to resolve the situation, as we need a solution that allows continued deployment from develop-2024 without affecting our main/prod routing.
