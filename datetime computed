Steps to Display Current DateTime in a T24 Enquiry

1. Navigate to the Enquiry Definition:

Go to ENQUIRY in the T24 user interface.

Select the enquiry you want to modify or create a new one.



2. Add a Computed Field:

In the Computed Fields section of the enquiry, add a new computed field.

Provide a Name for the field, such as CURRENT.DATETIME.

In the Computation field, enter the formula:

@DATE : ' ' : @TIME

This formula concatenates the current date and time.



3. Include the Computed Field in the Enquiry Columns:

Go to the Columns section of the enquiry.

Add a new row and select the computed field (CURRENT.DATETIME) you created in the previous step.

Provide a label, such as "Date & Time", and set its position.



4. Save and Run the Enquiry:

Save the enquiry definition.

Run the enquiry to see the current date and time autofilled in the designated column.
