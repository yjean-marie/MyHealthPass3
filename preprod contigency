Here’s a clean draft you can drop to Ajari as a quick message before formalizing it into an email:

Message to Ajari

Hi Ajari,
Quick question — for the upcoming SIT in pre-prog, I was thinking about a contingency plan. Since there’s always a chance that a production bug could push code/data through to pre-prog and impact the test data, how simple or straightforward would it be for the DB team to back up and restore the KFL0 and OpsDB databases if needed?

Just want to get a sense of feasibility before I draft something more formal for the wider team.

Do you want me to also draft the follow-up email version (assuming he says it’s doable) so you’re ready to send it straight after his feedback?
