Perfect — since this email goes to Manoj (L5 Director) and Sagar (App Custodian), it should:

✅ Summarize the situation succinctly (what was planned vs what happened).
✅ Clarify that the SRE Manager (Jitendra) confirmed the only path forward is an impacting incident + emergency CR.
✅ Emphasize urgency (must be done before 5:00 p.m.).
✅ Directly request their approval to proceed.

Here’s a polished draft:

Subject: Approval Request – Emergency CR for Apigee Producer Promotion

Hi Manoj and Sagar,

I’m requesting approval to proceed with an emergency change request (CR) for the Apigee producer promotion, which is required to enable the consumer promotion scheduled for 5:00 p.m. today and allow Digital Banking to proceed with their deployment activities.

Here’s a brief summary of the situation:

The original plan was to promote the producer under the existing CR.

Yesterday, the SRE team indicated that the promotion could proceed once the CR was approved, even if it fell outside the CR’s scheduled window.

Upon attempting the promotion today (October 15), we received an error confirming that the promotion must occur within the CR’s approved window.

Following discussions today with Jitendra [Last Name] (SRE Manager), it was confirmed that the only viable option to complete the promotion this afternoon is to raise an impacting incident and proceed with an emergency CR.


Given the dependency on this promotion for downstream activities, I’m requesting your approval to proceed with the emergency CR to avoid impacting the deployment timeline.

Please confirm if we can proceed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title / Team Name]
cc: Jitendra [Last Name] (SRE Manager), [Associate’s Name], [Your Manager’s Name]

Would you like me to make a slightly more executive-level version (shorter paragraphs, clearer bold emphasis on risk and impact) since it’s going to an L5 and App Custodian?
