Hey Priyanka — quick alignment on the vulnerability tracking we discussed.
We’ve got ~20 scanner findings, but they really map to about 4–5 distinct CVEs, some affecting multiple codebases. A number of these are high-priority findings and already escalated, so we do need to move on them quickly.
To keep things clean and traceable while we work through them, what I’m proposing is:
one Security / Vulnerability epic (or reuse an existing one if there is one),
one story per CVE, and
sub-tasks per affected codebase where applicable.
That avoids creating 20+ duplicated stories but still gives us clear visibility and tracking as we prioritise and pull them into sprints.
Let me know if that structure works for you, or if there’s an established approach you’d prefer us to follow.
