Story 1: Trigger Streamline Extract Job via API
Description:
As a backend developer, I want to expose an API endpoint that triggers the Streamline Extract job and immediately returns a jobId, so that I (or Stonebranch) can track the job’s progress asynchronously.

Story Points: 2

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Trigger Streamline Extract Job via API

Scenario: Job initiation successful
  Given the schedule-job API is accessible
  When a POST request is made to /create-streamline-extract with a valid token
  Then the service should call the schedule-job API to create a new job row with status = STARTED
  And return 200 OK with the jobId and tracking metadata

Scenario: Job initiation fails
  Given the job row cannot be created via the API
  When the request is made
  Then the API should return 500 Internal Server Error
  And no jobId should be returned
Implementation Notes:

Delegates job creation to schedule-job API

Returns jobId and timestamps

Logs errors if API fails

Subtasks:

 Define response format from schedule-job API (jobId, timestamps)

 Implement call to POST /jobs from Streamline trigger endpoint

 Handle API errors and log critical failures

 Return structured response to caller (e.g., Stonebranch)

✅ Story 2: Insert Job Start Record in schedule_job Table
Description:
As a system developer, I want to create a new schedule_job row when the job starts, so that we can track job initiations in the database.

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Insert job row via job tracking API

Scenario: New job begins
  Given a backend job is triggered
  When execution begins
  Then a POST request should be made to schedule-job API to insert a new job row with:
    | jobId            |
    | jobType          |
    | status = STARTED |
    | created_datetime |
    | scheduler_name   |
Implementation Notes:

schedule-job API responsible for persisting job

jobId is UUID

Subtasks:

 Design schedule-job API contract for POST /jobs

 Implement controller + service to persist job row

 Ensure jobId uniqueness, auto-capture timestamps

 Unit test job insertion (success + failure)

✅ Story 4: Configure Stonebranch to Trigger Streamline Job
Description:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure Stonebranch to call the job trigger API on a schedule, so that the job runs automatically without manual intervention.

Story Points: 2

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Stonebranch triggers Streamline job

Scenario: Job runs on schedule
  Given a scheduled time is reached
  When Stonebranch makes a POST request to /create-streamline-extract
  Then the API should respond with 200 OK and a jobId
  And a new job row should be created in the schedule-job table

Scenario: API is unreachable
  Given the job trigger API is down
  When Stonebranch runs the scheduled task
  Then Stonebranch should raise an alert or retry
Implementation Notes:

Uses cron 0 58 1 * * *

Relies on response from Story 1’s endpoint

Subtasks:

 Define HTTP call logic in Stonebranch

 Configure retry or alert logic on failure

 Capture jobId returned for tracking

 Test Stonebranch integration in DEV

✅ Story 5: Secure Streamline API with Bearer Token
Description:
As a developer, I want to secure the Streamline Extract API with a Bearer token, so that only authorized systems like Stonebranch can access it.

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: API authentication via Bearer token

Scenario: Token is present and valid
  Given a valid token is sent in the Authorization header
  When a request is made to /create-streamline-extract
  Then the API should accept the request and process the job

Scenario: Token is missing or invalid
  Given no token or an incorrect token is provided
  When a request is made
  Then the API should respond with 401 Unauthorized
Implementation Notes:

Token loaded from Vault

Must validate before any processing

Subtasks:

 Inject token into app config from Vault

 Add security filter for Bearer validation

 Return 401 for unauthorized access

 Test with valid and invalid tokens

✅ Story 6: Ensure Concurrency and Data Integrity for Job Tracking
Description:
As a backend engineer, I want to ensure job insert and update operations are concurrency-safe, so that multiple jobs don’t interfere with each other or cause data inconsistencies.

Story Points: 2

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Concurrency-safe job table writes

Scenario: Multiple jobs trigger at the same time
  Given two or more jobs are initiated concurrently
  When they write to the schedule-job API
  Then each should result in a distinct row with no conflicts

Scenario: Job is updated while another is running
  Given multiple jobs are running
  When their statuses are updated via API
  Then each update should apply only to the correct jobId
Implementation Notes:

jobId must be unique

schedule-job API must use atomic updates

Subtasks:

 Enforce UUID uniqueness for jobId

 Use DB-level locking or optimistic concurrency

 Write integration test for high-volume job triggers

✅ Story 7: Load Bearer Token from Vault for Streamline API
Description:
As a developer, I want the Bearer token for securing the Streamline API to be stored and loaded from Vault, so that secrets are not exposed in configuration files.

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Vault-based token management

Scenario: Token is successfully loaded
  Given the application starts
  When it initializes its security context
  Then it should retrieve the Bearer token from Vault

Scenario: Vault is unavailable
  Given the application cannot connect to Vault
  When startup is attempted
  Then it should log a clear error and fail to start securely
Implementation Notes:

Spring Vault recommended

Token pulled during app startup

Subtasks:

 Add Vault config and dependency

 Secure token access path

 Log errors gracefully on failure

 Verify token never logged or exposed

✅ Story 8: Expose API to Retrieve Job Status by ID
Description:
As a system integrator, I want to retrieve the status and metadata of a job using its ID, so that I can track its progress or final outcome without polling logs.

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Get job status by jobId

Scenario: Job exists
  Given a valid jobId exists
  When a GET request is made to schedule-job API at /job-status/{jobId}
  Then the API should return 200 OK
  And the response should include:
    | jobId             |
    | jobType           |
    | status            |
    | comment           |
    | retryCount        |
    | created_datetime  |
    | updated_datetime  |
    | scheduler_starttime |
    | scheduler_endtime   |

Scenario: Job does not exist
  Given an unknown jobId is provided
  When the request is made
  Then the API should return 404 Not Found
Implementation Notes:

Exposed by schedule-job API

Used by Stonebranch or UI to check progress

Subtasks:

 Define controller for GET /job-status/{jobId}

 Validate jobId (UUID format)

 Return metadata or 404 if not found

 Write unit tests for found and not found scenarios

✅ Story 9: Mark Job as Complete or Failed via schedule-job API
Description:
As a backend service, I want to explicitly mark a job as completed or failed in the schedule_job table, so that its lifecycle can be tracked accurately.

Story Points: 1

Acceptance Criteria:

gherkin
Copy
Edit
Feature: Finalize job status using schedule-job API

Scenario: Mark job as completed
  Given a job has finished successfully
  When the service completes its logic
  Then it should call PUT /jobs/{jobId} on the schedule-job API with:
    | status = COMPLETED       |
    | scheduler_endtime        |
    | updated_datetime         |
    | comment = "Job completed successfully" |

Scenario: Mark job as failed
  Given the job ends with an error
  When the update call is made
  Then the job row should be updated with:
    | status = FAILED          |
    | retryCount incremented   |
    | comment = error summary  |
    | scheduler_endtime        |
Implementation Notes:

Called by the business service after job completes

Updates status, retryCount, and comment fields

Subtasks:

 Implement PUT /jobs/{jobId} in schedule-job API

 Accept payload: status, comment, timestamps

 Apply retry logic for failures

 Validate status transitions (e.g., only mark completed once)

 Test both success and failure flows
