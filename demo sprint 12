Here‚Äôs a clean, professional slide draft with space for a before/after performance table, and a matching script to help you present it during your Sprint 13 demo.

Presentation Script

> ‚ÄúThis marks the end of Sprint 13, and we‚Äôre happy to share that we‚Äôve completed work on all six client notification jobs.
Each of these jobs has now been refactored to use the new Client API and our fully normalized notice_transaction table.

This sprint was all about pushing the efficiency gains even further. Just like we saw with the SendSMS job earlier, all six jobs now show major performance improvements.

You can see the before-and-after runtimes in the table here ‚Äî for example, SendSMS went from 68 seconds to just 3 seconds.

Overall, these improvements reduce system load, improve responsiveness, and make the jobs easier to manage long-term.‚Äù
