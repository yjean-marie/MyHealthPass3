Hereâ€™s the Jira story for the consumer service, which will process A2A recurring and post-dated payment instructions after they have been pushed to the Kafka queue.

Title:
Consumer Service for Processing A2A Recurring and Post-Dated Transactions


---

Description:
As a Developer,
I want to develop a Kafka consumer service as part of the Recurrence Engine,
which will consume messages from the Kafka queue containing A2A recurring or post-dated payment instructions,
so that the transactions can be processed via the T24 API (a2apub) and the instruction status can be updated accordingly.

Assumptions:

1. The consumer will listen to specific Kafka topics related to A2A transactions and process them sequentially.


2. The consumer must ensure idempotency to avoid processing duplicate messages.


3. Error handling mechanisms such as retries and dead-letter queues (DLQ) will be implemented to handle failed transactions.


4. The consumer should process messages in a timely manner to meet SLA requirements.


5. The system should be able to scale horizontally by running multiple consumer instances.


6. Transaction logs will be stored for audit and monitoring purposes.



Technical Considerations:

The Kafka consumer should use an appropriate consumer group to ensure distributed processing across instances.

The service should log each transaction status (success, failure, retries) in ELK (Kibana) for observability.

Error handling should include retries with exponential backoff before moving to a DLQ.

The consumer should ensure that messages are processed in the correct order if required (by using partitioning or key-based processing).

Monitoring alerts should be set up for failed transactions via Prometheus or ELK alerts.


Dependencies:

The Kafka cluster should be available and properly configured with relevant topics and partitions.

T24 API (a2apub) should be available for processing transactions.

The instruction API should be available for updating transaction statuses.

The consumer should be tested for concurrency and load capacity.

Acceptance Criteria:

Scenario 1 - Successful Transaction Processing
Given a valid A2A transaction message is published to the Kafka queue,
When the consumer picks up the message,
Then it should call the T24 API (a2apub) to process the transaction,
And update the instruction status via the instruction API,
And log the successful processing details.

Scenario 2 - Handling Failed Transactions with Retry
Given an A2A transaction message is published but processing fails,
When the consumer encounters an error while calling the T24 API,
Then it should retry the request based on the retry policy,
And move the message to the DLQ after exhausting retries,
And log the failure for investigation.

Scenario 3 - Idempotency Handling
Given an A2A transaction message that has already been processed,
When the consumer picks up the same message again,
Then it should detect the duplicate and prevent reprocessing,
And log the duplicate detection event.

Scenario 4 - Concurrent Consumer Handling
Given multiple instances of the consumer service running,
When messages arrive in the Kafka topic,
Then they should be distributed across consumers based on Kafka's partitioning,
And processed without duplication or conflicts.

Scenario 5 - Partial Processing Failure
Given an A2A transaction where the payment succeeds but the instruction API update fails,
When the consumer processes the message,
Then it should log the partial failure,
And retry updating the instruction API separately,
And ensure reconciliation measures are in place.

Scenario 6 - Monitoring and Alerts
Given an A2A transaction processing failure,
When the failure count exceeds a threshold,
Then an alert should be triggered via monitoring tools,
And logs should provide sufficient diagnostic information.

This refined story ensures that the consumer service is resilient, scalable, and fault-tolerant while providing detailed observability and error handling mechanisms. Let me know if you need any adjustments!
