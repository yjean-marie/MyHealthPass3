Got it — here’s a polished but still natural-sounding draft reply you can send back to Delete. It acknowledges her points, explains your side, and shows accountability without being defensive:

Hi Delete,

Apologies for the late response, and thank you for sharing your thoughts — I completely understand where you’re coming from.

The main challenge with KFL0 is that it’s such a heavily audited app code. Every step we take has a long list of requirements, and sometimes it feels like the process itself isn’t fully trusted. That’s part of why deployments end up feeling heavier and slower than they should, and I know that translates into added pressure on your side as well.

I fully agree with your point about the MOP — you’re right, everything in the MOP needs to line up with what’s in production. That one’s on me, and I’ll make sure all the steps are reflected directly in the MOP instead of just in the implementation plan.

More broadly, I know the last-minute issues and drawn-out deployment times aren’t how this should work. They’re a consequence of the extra scrutiny that comes with this app code, and while it’s unavoidable to some extent, I recognize it makes things more challenging for you and the team. I’ll keep working to tighten things up so it’s less of a crunch.

I also confirmed with Edward that, yes, the firecall ID requirement does seem unusual. I’ll follow up with Sagar on that, because I agree it doesn’t feel like normal behavior.

Thanks again for flagging this — I really do appreciate the honesty and the push to make the process better.

Best,
Yuri

Do you want me to make this sound a little more casual (like a direct chat message), or keep it polished and email-ready?
