Subject: Application for Paternity Leave

Dear HRAdvice,

I am writing to formally apply for paternity leave. Please find attached the medical certificate, which indicates the date of confinement as November 24, 2023.

I understand that the application should typically be submitted at least three months in advance, and I regret that my request is being submitted later than expected. However, I was hoping to commence my leave slightly before the confinement date and would be grateful for your guidance on how best to proceed in this circumstance.

Kindly let me know the next steps and if any additional documentation or actions are required on my part.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Best regards,
Sherrell Jean-Marie

Would you like me to also propose specific dates for when you’d like your leave to start and end, so the email looks more complete and avoids back-and-forth with HR?
