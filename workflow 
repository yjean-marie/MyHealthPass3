Here’s the full chatbot password reset workflow, incorporating secure authentication, Entrust OTP integration, and a fallback for users without two-factor authentication. It mirrors the in-person service center flow and is aligned with best practices for a regulated banking environment.

🔐 Chatbot Password Reset Workflow

Step 1: Initiation

Trigger: User types something like “I forgot my password” or selects "Reset Password" from the chatbot menu.

Chatbot Response:
“No problem! Let’s get you verified so we can help you reset your password.”



---

Step 2: Identify the Client

Chatbot prompts:

1. “Please enter your full name as it appears on your account.”


2. “Now enter the last 4 digits of your account number.”



Purpose: These two inputs help uniquely identify the individual in a multi-person account scenario.



---

Step 3: Confirm Delivery Method for OTP

Chatbot Response (after lookup): “Thanks! I’ve found your record. I’ll now send a one-time code to your registered contact.”

> 🟢 “Is it okay if I send the code to your email ending in @mail.com?”
OR
🟢 “I’ll send the code to your phone number ending in 1234.”



User confirms (or selects an alternative if multiple are available).



---

Step 4: OTP Verification (via Entrust API)

Action: Chatbot calls the Entrust API to trigger OTP.

Chatbot Message:
“A one-time password has been sent. Please enter it here to continue.”

User enters OTP

Chatbot verifies OTP via Entrust API response.



---

Step 5: Check for 2FA Setup

Chatbot checks user profile to see if two-factor authentication (2FA) is already enabled.


✅ If 2FA is already enabled:

Chatbot Response:
“Great! Since you already have 2FA enabled, you can reset your password using the Forgot Password option in the app or website. I’ll send you a quick link just in case.”


❌ If 2FA is NOT enabled:

Chatbot Response:
“We’ll need to set up two-factor authentication to secure your account. Let’s walk through that now.”



---

Step 6: 2FA Onboarding

Steps:

1. Guide the user to enable 2FA using their preferred method (e.g., SMS, authenticator app).


2. Confirm 2FA setup is successful.



Chatbot Response:
“Awesome! Two-factor authentication is now active.”



---

Step 7: Issue One-Time Password (OTP Login)

Action: Once 2FA is set up, the chatbot issues a one-time password (not to be confused with the verification OTP) for immediate login.

Chatbot Message:
“Here’s your temporary login code: X9F7KL. Please use this within the next 10 minutes to log in and reset your password.”



---

Step 8: Password Reset

User logs in using the one-time password.

User navigates to password reset section in-app or web.

User resets password successfully.



---

Step 9: Confirmation

Chatbot follows up: “You’re all set! Your password has been updated. Anything else I can help you with today?”



---

🔁 Fallback Scenarios

🚫 No Valid Contact Method Found:

“I wasn’t able to find a valid email or phone number on file. Please contact our service center at 800-XXXX to update your information.”


🧠 User Fails OTP 3 Times:

“It looks like you’ve entered the wrong code a few times. For your security, I’ll need to direct you to a live agent for further help.”
