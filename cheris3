Got it! Here's a version that reflects that you're reaching out for the first time:

Hi Cherise, I hope you’re doing well. We haven’t spoken before, but I work at RBC and am reaching out to help a family friend who’s been trying to resolve a pension matter for her sister, who lives abroad. They mentioned they haven’t received responses to their follow-up emails and are understandably concerned. I know there may be valid reasons for the delay, but if you could provide an update or suggest the next steps, it would be greatly appreciated. I can also share their contact number if it’s easier to give them a quick call. Thanks so much for your help!

This introduction acknowledges that it's your first time reaching out while still keeping it light and professional. How does this feel?
