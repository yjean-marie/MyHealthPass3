🗣️ Presentation Script

> “As a wrap-up for Sprint 13, we didn’t just focus on optimizing the jobs — we also completed unit testing for all six client notification jobs that were refactored.

A big part of the sprint was spent supporting SMS testing — this included validating behavior, fixing bugs quickly, and collaborating with QA to surface any new requirements.

We also supported release prep and coordination for both the SMS job and Stonebranch deployment.

Overall, this sprint not only delivered efficiency gains but also ensured those changes were thoroughly tested and production-ready.”
