Hereâ€™s a clean, respectful draft you can send to Patrice. It explains your situation, emphasizes your main reason, notes the secondary factor (visa), and politely asks about the process and likelihood of a deferral.

Draft Message to Patrice

Subject: Request for Guidance on Deferring Performance Cruise

Hi Patrice,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to reach out regarding the upcoming performance cruise in January. Unfortunately, I am unable to attend this year, as my wife and I are expecting our baby on November 24th. By the time of the cruise, our newborn would only be just over a month old, and I will also still be on paternity leave. Given the circumstances, it would be difficult for me to participate.

A secondary consideration is that I do not yet have a U.S. visa, which would also pose a challenge for travel.

I see that there is an option to defer, and I would like to explore that possibility. Could you kindly let me know what the deferral process entails, whether it requires approval, and what my chances would be of securing a spot next year if I defer? I want to ensure I have the correct understanding of the steps and expectations.

Thank you very much for your guidance and support.

Warm regards,
Sherrell

Do you want me to make this more formal corporate style (closer to how RBC leadership writes) or keep it personal but professional (more in your tone)?
