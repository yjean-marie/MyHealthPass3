Timeline & Ownership Details

Formation of First Citizens Bank (FCB):
In September 1993, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) merged three failing indigenous banks (Workers' Bank, National Commercial Bank, and Trinidad Co‑operative Bank) into the newly formed First Citizens Bank Ltd., under vesting orders issued by the Finance Minister. At that time, all those institutions were already wholly owned or controlled by the government. 

Government Shareholding:
As of the financial statements dated 30 September 2021, First Citizens Bank Limited is a subsidiary of First Citizens Holdings Limited (FCHL), which is wholly owned by the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. FCHL maintains a 64.43% controlling interest in the bank, while the remainder is traded on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange. 

Ministry Oversight:
The Ministry of Finance lists First Citizens Holdings Limited among the wholly owned enterprises it oversees, with FCB listed among the companies that are indirectly owned by the government.
