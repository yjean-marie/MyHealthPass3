Goal: World Leader in AI Insights

Objective: Drive efficiency in software development through GenAI with at least three areas showing a 10% improvement in productivity overall (e.g., leveraging Copilot or CodeWhisperer).

My Feedback:
Over the review period (March 31 – present), I consistently leveraged GitHub Copilot across multiple development streams to accelerate code generation, refactoring, and technical user story creation.
Copilot contributed approximately 925 AI-generated lines of code out of 2,963 total lines, representing a 31% assisted coding rate.
This placed me 18th overall team-wide in Copilot productivity metrics under Monica’s L4 group.
AI-assisted coding has notably improved efficiency and turnaround time for key KYC deliverables, including Feature 4 (Stonebranch onboarding), Feature 5 (Client API integration), and the Schedule Job API.

Self-Rating: ✅ Fully Met (Achieved All and Exceeded)
Rationale:

Consistent and measurable GenAI adoption (31% AI-assisted coding rate).

Improved productivity and quality across multiple deliverables.

Ranked 18th overall in Copilot productivity metrics.

Demonstrated use of GenAI beyond coding, including user story generation and refactoring.

Would you like me to add a short one-line “Next Steps” for this one (e.g., “Expand Copilot use into automated testing and API documentation to achieve top-10 team ranking next cycle”)? It adds a strong forward-looking finish that RBC reviewers typically like.
