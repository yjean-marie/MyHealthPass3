Got it — thanks for the context. You want it to sound smoother and professional, while also making it clear that they need to handle this before their offshore start time. Here’s a refined version of your email:

Subject: Validation of Executed Jobs – Feature 5 Deployment to UAT

Good morning,

Kindly requesting your assistance in validating the results for all executed jobs outlined in the Technical PIV section of this document:
[Confluence Link]

All jobs were run following the successful deployment of Feature 5 code and migration via MOP.

Teleios Inbound and Streamline Inbound jobs require files to be created and then rerun for a successful outcome.

SMS and Streamline have already been executed, and the results table will indicate the clients that were notified.

ScheduleClientNotice inserted new records into the NoticeTransaction and NoticeTransactionBck tables. Please verify against OPSDB.


Kindly prioritize this validation ahead of your offshore start time so results are available for early review.

Kind regards,
Yuri Jean-Marie

Would you like me to also make a shorter checklist-style version (more “action-driven” for the devs), or do you prefer this explanatory style with a bit more detail?
