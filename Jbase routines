Certainly! Here's how to write the routine in jBC (jBASE BASIC) for T24 Classic to replace the country code with the country name in the same field.

jBC Code to Replace the Country Code with Country Name

SUBROUTINE FETCH.COUNTRY.NAME(VERSION.REC, VERSION.COMMON, FLAGS, RETURN.STATUS)
   $INSERT I_COMMON  ;* Common Inserts for T24 Versions
   $INSERT I_EQUATE  ;* Common Equates

   COUNTRY.CODE.POS = 5  ;* Replace with actual position of the country code field

   ;* Retrieve the country code from the version record
   COUNTRY.CODE = TRIM(VERSION.REC<COUNTRY.CODE.POS>)

   ;* Check if the country code has been entered
   IF COUNTRY.CODE THEN

      ;* Open the COUNTRY.TABLE file (replace 'COUNTRY.TABLE' with the actual name of your country table)
      OPEN "COUNTRY.TABLE" TO COUNTRY.FILE ELSE
         RETURN.STATUS = "COUNTRY TABLE NOT FOUND"
         RETURN
      END

      ;* Attempt to read the country name using the country code
      READ COUNTRY.REC FROM COUNTRY.FILE, COUNTRY.CODE ELSE
         ;* If country code is invalid or not found
         RETURN.STATUS = "INVALID COUNTRY CODE"
         RETURN
      END

      ;* Replace the country code with the country name from the country table
      VERSION.REC<COUNTRY.CODE.POS> = COUNTRY.REC<1>  ;* Assuming the first field contains the country name
   END ELSE
      ;* If no country code was entered, clear the field (optional)
      VERSION.REC<COUNTRY.CODE.POS> = ""
   END

   RETURN
END

Key Points:

1. Country Code Field:

COUNTRY.CODE.POS: The field position in the VERSION.REC where the country code is entered and where the country name will be replaced. Update this with the correct position from your version.



2. Country Table Lookup:

The routine opens the COUNTRY.TABLE (which should map country codes to country names).

It reads the country record based on the country code entered.

If the code exists, it fetches the country name (from the first field in the country record) and replaces the country code in the same field.



3. Handling Errors:

If the country code is not found, the routine returns an error message.

You can modify the error handling logic as needed, depending on your business requirements.



4. No Second Field:

The country name replaces the entered country code in the same field, as requested.




Compile and Catalog the Routine

1. Compile the Routine: After writing the routine, you need to compile it in jBASE. Run the following command:

BASIC BP FETCH.COUNTRY.NAME


2. Catalog the Routine: Once the routine is compiled, catalog it so that it can be used in T24:

CATALOG BP FETCH.COUNTRY.NAME



Attach the Routine to the Version

1. Open the Version in Version Maintenance:

Use OV or another T24 command to open the version in maintenance mode.



2. Attach the Routine:

Attach the routine FETCH.COUNTRY.NAME to the field validation or commit trigger for the field where the country code is entered.


Example:

If the country code field is in position 5, attach the routine to the Validation Routine for that field.



3. Save and Test:

Save the version and test it by entering a country code. The routine should automatically replace the country code with the corresponding country name.




Testing

Enter the country code (e.g., TT).

After validation (or upon moving out of the field), the country name (Trinidad and Tobago) should replace the country code in the same field.
