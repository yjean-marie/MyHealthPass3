Thanks, that clarification is spot on. You're no longer using the Message and MessageLog tables — the delivery status and error now need to be stored directly in the existing Notice_V1 table, which has three sets of columns, one for each notice type:

notice1_message_id, notice1_delivery_status, notice1_error_message

notice2_message_id, notice2_delivery_status, notice2_error_message

notice3_message_id, notice3_delivery_status, notice3_error_message


Here’s your updated Story 3.

✅ Story 3: Update Delivery Status on Notice_V1 from Teleios File

As a developer,
I want to update the Notice_V1 table with delivery status and error message fields based on the message IDs returned in the Teleios delivery file,
so that the system can track the outcome of SMS sends for each notice type (notice1, notice2, notice3) within the same table.


---

🔄 Implementation Notes

The daily delivery file uploaded to S3 contains:

message_id,timestamp,status,error_message,run_date

Match message_id to one of the three message ID fields on Notice_V1:

notice1_message_id

notice2_message_id

notice3_message_id


For the match:

Update corresponding *_delivery_status, *_error_message, and possibly a *_status_timestamp (if you want to track when it was updated).


Important: Only one field should match — you should not update multiple notice columns per record.

✅ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)

Feature: Update delivery status on Notice_V1 from Teleios delivery file

  Scenario: Matching message ID to notice1
    Given the delivery file contains message_id "abc123"
    And a record exists in Notice_V1 with notice1_message_id = "abc123"
    When the job runs
    Then update notice1_delivery_status with the file’s status
    And update notice1_error_message with the file’s error_message
    And update notice1_status_timestamp with the file’s timestamp

  Scenario: Matching message ID to notice2
    Given the delivery file contains message_id "def456"
    And it matches notice2_message_id
    Then update the notice2_delivery_status, notice2_error_message, and timestamp

  Scenario: Matching message ID to notice3
    Given the delivery file contains message_id "ghi789"
    And it matches notice3_message_id
    Then update the notice3_delivery_status, notice3_error_message, and timestamp

  Scenario: File contains unknown message ID
    Given the message_id "xyz999" does not exist in any noticeX_message_id fields
    Then skip the row
    And log a warning: "Unknown message_id xyz999 not found in Notice_V1"

  Scenario: File contains malformed row
    Given a row is missing a required field or improperly formatted
    Then log the row and skip processing it

  Scenario: File not found in S3
    Given no delivery file exists for the expected run_date
    Then log a critical error:
      "Teleios delivery file not found for expected date"

  Scenario: Manual trigger via API
    Given the job is triggered via API
    Then log: "Manual trigger: Teleios delivery job executed via API"

  Scenario: Multiple message IDs match (should not happen)
    Given a message_id exists in multiple noticeX_message_id fields
    Then log a critical error and skip the record:
      "Ambiguous message_id: found in multiple notice columns"


---

🧪 QA Checklist

✅ Simulate a delivery file with valid entries — confirm status and error columns are updated appropriately.

✅ Simulate unknown message_id — confirm row is skipped and logged.

✅ Simulate malformed row — confirm valid rows processed, bad one logged.

✅ Confirm that only one notice column is updated per record.

✅ Confirm log messages on API/manual trigger and missing file scenarios.



---

Let me know if you'd like subtasks for:

Parsing and matching logic

Integration with S3

API vs Cron trigger

Unit tests


Or if the naming of columns (*_status_timestamp) differs from your schema.

Yes — that makes perfect sense, and it's a smart move for operational hygiene. Archiving the processed delivery status file helps:

Prevent clutter in the active folder.

Avoid re-processing the same file.

Maintain a history for audits or replays.


Here’s your next story:

✅ Story 4: Archive Delivery File After Successful Processing

As a developer,
I want to move the processed Teleios delivery status file from the active folder to an archive folder in the same S3 bucket,
so that we avoid reprocessing and keep the incoming folder clean and manageable.


---

📁 Folder Structure in S3

Bucket: rbc-client-delivery (or whatever your actual bucket name is)

Incoming folder: teleios/sms-delivery-status/

Archive folder: teleios/sms-delivery-status-archive/



---

🔄 Implementation Notes

Archive only after successful processing of the file.

Move (not copy) the file from:

s3://rbc-client-delivery/teleios/sms-delivery-status/delivery-status-YYYYMMDD.csv

to:

s3://rbc-client-delivery/teleios/sms-delivery-status-archive/delivery-status-YYYYMMDD.csv

Maintain the same file name in the archive folder.

If the move fails, log an error and do not delete the original.

Archive step should not prevent the job from succeeding (non-blocking).



---

✅ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)

Feature: Archive Teleios delivery file after processing

  Scenario: File is successfully processed
    Given the delivery file has been parsed and matched successfully
    When processing is complete
    Then move the file to the archive folder "teleios/sms-delivery-status-archive/"
    And preserve the original file name

  Scenario: File move fails due to permission or network issue
    Given the file was processed
    But the archive move fails
    Then log an error:
      "Failed to archive file delivery-status-YYYYMMDD.csv to archive folder"
    And retain the file in the original folder

  Scenario: File already exists in archive (edge case)
    Given a file with the same name exists in the archive folder
    Then rename the archived version with a timestamp suffix, e.g. `delivery-status-YYYYMMDD-duplicate.csv`
    And move the processed file with the new name

  Scenario: Archive folder does not exist
    Given the archive folder is missing
    When the job attempts to move the file
    Then automatically create the folder
    And move the file successfully


---

🧪 QA Checklist

✅ Simulate full job run with mock file — confirm file is moved post-processing.

✅ Confirm file no longer exists in original folder.

✅ Confirm content in archive is identical.

✅ Simulate move failure — ensure log is written and file remains.

✅ Confirm job still succeeds if archiving fails.



---

Would you like subtasks for the file move logic or want to include a unit test to validate archive path construction?



Perfect — thanks for the field-level specificity. Here's the final refined Gherkin acceptance criteria for the story that updates the Notice_V1 table based on the Teleios delivery status file, now reflecting the exact fields and their naming pattern.

✅ Final Acceptance Criteria – Story 3: Update Delivery Status on Notice_V1

Feature: Update Notice_V1 with mapped delivery status from Teleios delivery file

  Background:
    Given the Teleios file includes: message_id, timestamp, status (text), error_message, run_date
    And the system only considers "DELIVERED" as a successful delivery
    And all other statuses are treated as retryable failures (mapped to 1)
    And the Notice_V1 table has fields:
      - notice_01_method_01_status
      - notice_01_method_01_field_reason
      - updated_datetime

  Scenario: Map "DELIVERED" to status = 0
    Given the file contains message_id "abc123" with status "DELIVERED"
    And it matches notice_01_message_id in Notice_V1
    When the job runs
    Then set notice_01_method_01_status = 0
    And set notice_01_method_01_field_reason = null
    And set updated_datetime = the timestamp from the file

  Scenario: Map any other status to status = 1 and log the error message
    Given the file contains message_id "def456" with status "REJECTED" and error_message "Number invalid"
    And it matches notice_02_message_id in Notice_V1
    When the job runs
    Then set notice_02_method_01_status = 1
    And set notice_02_method_01_field_reason = "Number invalid"
    And set updated_datetime = the timestamp from the file

  Scenario: No error_message provided for non-DELIVERED status
    Given the file contains message_id "ghi789" with status "FAILED"
    And error_message is blank
    When the job runs
    Then set the corresponding noticeX_method_01_status = 1
    And set noticeX_method_01_field_reason = null
    And set updated_datetime

  Scenario: Unknown message_id
    Given message_id "unknown000" is not found in any of notice_01/02/03_message_id fields
    Then skip the row
    And log a warning:
      "Warning: message_id unknown000 not found in Notice_V1"

  Scenario: Malformed or incomplete row
    Given a row is missing message_id or status
    Then skip the row
    And log:
      "Malformed row encountered: <row details>"

  Scenario: File not found
    Given no delivery file exists in S3 for the current day
    Then log a critical error:
      "Delivery file not found for processing"


---

🧠 Notes:

This version directly ties message_id → notice_01/02/03_message_id, and maps accordingly to:

notice_01_method_01_status

notice_01_method_01_field_reason

updated_datetime


It also preserves extensibility: if you later want to distinguish true failures (-1), we can extend this mapping logic.


Let me know if you're ready for the next story (archiving the processed file), or want this wrapped as a formal Jira ticket with description and subtasks.
