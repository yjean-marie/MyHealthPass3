Perfect — that helps lock in the intent.
So this version should:
✅ Document the sequence of events clearly (what was said yesterday, what was discovered today).
✅ Emphasize the urgency and impact.
✅ Request explicit confirmation from Jitendra that raising an impacting incident and emergency CR is indeed the only option.

Here’s the refined version:

Subject: Confirmation Required – Apigee Producer Promotion and Emergency CR

Hi Jitendra,

I’m documenting our discussions from October 14 and 15 regarding the Apigee producer promotion, and seeking confirmation on the next steps.

What was confirmed yesterday (Oct 14):
The producer could be promoted once the change request (CR) was approved, regardless of the CR’s scheduled date window.

What we discovered today (Oct 15):
During today’s promotion attempt, we received an error indicating that the promotion cannot proceed outside of the approved CR window. It must occur strictly within the approved CR timeframe.

Next steps discussed:
Based on today’s conversation, the only option presented was to raise an impacting incident and proceed with an emergency CR to complete the producer promotion this afternoon.


Could you please confirm that this is indeed the only viable path forward to ensure the producer can be promoted before 5:00 p.m. today, allowing the consumer promotion and Digital Banking deployment to continue as planned?

Best regards,

Would you like me to make it slightly firmer — for example, noting that the earlier guidance led to the timing conflict — or keep it neutral to avoid sounding accusatory?
