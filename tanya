Hi, good morning. Hope you're doing well.

I'm doing a bit of informal probing related to an issue I'm trying to solve for the KYC project. I was liaising with Akel from the DataHub team, and we're trying to determine whether the digital profile record (I believe it's called "mobilizr") is in any way linked to the core client record.

From what I understand, there may be heuristic services that implicitly link profiles across various systems using shared datapoints like name, address, or contact information. I'm not entirely sure how this linkage works under the hood, but I’m curious to know if there’s any data-level connection between the digital profile and the core client.

Let me know if you want a more casual tone or if this is going into a formal email.
