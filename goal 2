Perfect — you’re absolutely on the right track.

For this goal (Operational Excellence) with sub-goals around project execution and DevOps improvements, your progress sounds like it’s in the Fully Met (Achieved all and exceeded) category, based on:

Timely and complete delivery of the KYC 2024 stream initiatives.

Successful support for Amplify (Agentic KYC) delivery.

Branching strategy implemented across all repos (GitFlow variant).

DAU (Daily Active User) or Dora metrics improvement.


Once you share the exact DAU/Dora improvement percentage, I’ll include that in the final version.

Here’s a draft of the feedback for now — ready to finalize once you confirm the DAU number:

Goal: Operational Excellence

Objective: Deliver all projects and initiatives on time, within budget and scope (e.g., KYC changes, Amplify). Implement branching strategy, strengthen GitHub protection, and improve Dora metrics by 5% year-over-year.

My Feedback:
All key KYC 2024 stream deliverables were completed on schedule and within scope, including Feature 4 (Stonebranch onboarding), Feature 5 (Client API integration), SMS delivery tracking, and the Reapply Restraint automation.
Additionally, I provided technical leadership and support for the Amplify Agentic KYC solution, contributing to the successful completion of both document verification and orchestration components.
On the DevOps side, I implemented a GitHub branching strategy (modified GitFlow) across all 16 repositories, standardizing collaboration and reducing merge conflicts.
Our DAU/Dora metrics improved significantly over the period, reflecting better pipeline performance and deployment reliability across environments.

Self-Rating: ✅ Fully Met (Achieved All and Exceeded)
Rationale:

All KYC 2024 and Amplify initiatives delivered within scope and timeline.

Branching strategy implemented and adopted team-wide.

Dora metrics improved (final percentage to be inserted).

Enhanced pipeline governance and operational stability.

Once you give me the DAU/Dora percentage improvement, I’ll drop it in and polish the final version for submission.
Do you want me to hold wording neutral (e.g., “improved by over 5%”) or emphasize it as “exceeded target improvement” if the gain is significant (e.g., >8–10%)?
