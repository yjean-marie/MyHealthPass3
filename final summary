Here’s an updated version that incorporates your collaboration with multiple teams:

"This year, I made significant strides in advancing RBC’s objectives through a diverse range of high-impact projects, including the development and deployment of the EYP0 Core-Agnostic APIs. Beyond core project work, I contributed to broader initiatives such as the GenAI-powered chatbot POC and ELK integration for enhanced monitoring and SRE improvements, further strengthening our platform’s reliability and adaptability.

A key part of this success was our strong collaboration across teams. Internally, I worked closely with other senior software developers and BSAs, fostering a cohesive and productive environment. Externally, we built a close, effective partnership with our QE team, working hand-in-hand to align testing and development efforts seamlessly. Additionally, we maintained productive working relationships with the Originations and KYC teams, facilitating smooth integration with EYP0 and ensuring alignment across all stakeholders.

Despite some challenges in effectively communicating the full depth of our contributions, these collaborative efforts laid a strong foundation for future scalability and innovation. The accomplishments achieved this year reflect our team’s dedication to delivering robust and impactful solutions that align with RBC’s commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement."
