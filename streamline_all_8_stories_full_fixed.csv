Summary,Description,Story Points,Acceptance Criteria,Implementation Notes,Issue Type,Epic Link
Trigger Streamline Extract Job via API,"As a backend developer, I want to expose an API endpoint that triggers the Streamline Extract job and returns tracking information, so that I (or Stonebranch) can initiate and monitor job execution.",2,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 1,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 1,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Insert Job Start Record in schedule_job Table,"As a system developer, I want to create a new schedule_job row when the job starts, so that we can track job initiations in the database.",1,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 2,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 2,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
"Update Job Completion, Retry Count, and Comments","As a developer or operator, I want to update the schedule_job row with the job status, retry count, outcome summary, and scheduler end time, so that we have complete tracking of the execution.",2,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 3,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 3,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Configure Stonebranch to Trigger Streamline Job,"As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure Stonebranch to call the API on a schedule, so that the job runs automatically without manual action.",2,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 4,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 4,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Secure Streamline API with Bearer Token,"As a developer, I want to secure the Streamline Extract API with a Bearer token, so that only authorized systems like Stonebranch can access it.",1,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 5,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 5,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Ensure Concurrency and Data Integrity for Job Tracking,"As a backend engineer, I want to ensure job insert/update operations are concurrency-safe and isolated, so that parallel jobs donâ€™t overwrite or corrupt tracking data.",2,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 6,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 6,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Load Bearer Token from Vault for Streamline API,"As a developer, I want the Bearer token for API security to be stored and loaded from Vault, so that we avoid exposing secrets in code or config files.",1,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 7,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 7,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
Expose API to Retrieve Job Status by ID,"As a backend user or system integrator, I want to retrieve the status and metadata of a previously triggered job using its ID, so that I can check job progress or outcome asynchronously.",1,Gherkin acceptance criteria for Story 8,TDD-style implementation notes for Story 8,Story,STREAMLINE-EPIC
