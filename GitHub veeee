Got it—you're right. I’ve added the missing point about merging branches to main to create the release and kept the other technical blockers. I’m giving you both emails again, with the technical one tightened up.

Technical Status Update (final)

Subject: Detailed Progress on Helios V2 (GitHub Actions) Migration & Release

Hi Team,

Here’s where we are from a technical standpoint:

1. Helios V2 Migration (GitHub Actions):
All five Java Spring Boot repos are running in Dev under Helios V2. Because V2 doesn’t mirror Helios V1 out of the box, we’re configuring GitHub Environments (approval gates, secrets) to match our prior promotion model.


2. Release Merges & Tagging:
We have not yet merged feature branches into main or tagged an official release. We’re validating the new pipelines first to avoid churn; once stable, we’ll merge to main, tag the release, and begin promotions.


3. SonarQube Quality Gate (current blocker):
The gate is blocking promotion to QA. Targets are 70% coverage and < 100 code smells; meeting these across all repos will be challenging in the short term. We’re evaluating whether to temporarily relax/bypass the gate so QA can start while we continue improving coverage and code quality.


4. Higher-Environment Workflow Setup:
We’re standing up QA, UAT, and PreProd environments in the workflows (env variables, secrets, approval rules). This step is sensitive to naming conventions and missing variables, so we’re validating carefully to prevent failed runs.


5. Next Steps (target ~3 days):

Decide on SonarQube enforcement (temporary relax/bypass vs. strict).

Finalize GitHub Environment approvals/secrets for QA/UAT/PreProd.

Merge to main, create the release tag, and promote to QA.




Best,

Business Status Update (final)

Subject: Update on Release & Migration Timeline (Helios V2)

Dear Team,

All five applications have been moved to Helios V2 and are running in the Development environment. We’re completing the final configuration steps (quality checks and approval workflows) that are required before promoting to QA, UAT, and Pre-Prod. These are normal first-cycle migration activities and will streamline future releases.

We expect about three more days to complete this setup, merge to main, create the release, and start QA testing.

Thanks for your patience as we wrap up this transition.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
