Got it! That definitely sounds like a bug since it's incorrect behavior and impacts functionality. Here's a draft for your Jira ticket:

Type: Bug

Summary: Incorrect Message ID Returned by SMS API

Description: We discovered that our SMS API is returning the wrong message ID in its response. Instead of returning the message ID generated by the Teleios API, which is passed back through the RLQ0 API, we are currently returning the message ID that we initially generated and sent to RLQ0. This causes issues with follow-up actions, such as retrieving delivery status, because the returned ID does not match the Teleios-generated ID.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Trigger an SMS send request via the SMS API.


2. Observe the message ID returned in the response.


3. Compare it with the Teleios-generated message ID received through RLQ0.



Expected Result: The SMS API should return the message ID generated by Teleios.

Actual Result: The SMS API returns the initially generated message ID instead of the Teleios-generated one.

Priority: High

Assignee: [Assign to the relevant developer or team]
