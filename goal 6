Goal: Deliver on Major Programs and Key Initiatives

Objective: Improve efficiency through process automation, database deployment modernization, and centralized logging to support business partner strategies and priorities.

My Feedback:
During this cycle, I collaborated on a proof of concept using Ada for automated database deployment, working alongside a colleague to validate its feasibility for streamlining database release processes and promoting consistency across environments.
I also verified that all services deployed to OCP4 successfully log to Elastic (ELK) and confirmed centralized visibility for operational monitoring and audit purposes. Additionally, I worked with the Production Support team to demonstrate how to locate and interpret these logs within ELK for day-to-day support activities.
This collaboration strengthened our team’s understanding of current monitoring capabilities and laid the groundwork for future improvements in in-service logging quality and observability.

Self-Rating: ✅ Fully Met (Achieved All and Exceeded)
Rationale:

Collaborated on Ada POC for automated database deployment.

Verified centralized Elastic logging coverage for all OCP4 services.

Supported Production Support team in leveraging ELK for monitoring and audit use.

Identified next step: improve in-service log quality for deeper insights and diagnostics.
