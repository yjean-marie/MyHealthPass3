Here’s a draft you can send to Manoj and Sagar based on what you described — professional but still clear and context-rich.

Subject: Resolution of AquaScan P1 Vulnerability – Tomcat Embed Core

Hi Manoj, Hi Sagar,

A P1 AquaScan vulnerability was recently raised against one of our GitHub repositories. This was related to the Tomcat Embed Core package (version 10.1.34) that we have already addressed in all active branches through prior updates.

In this case, a developer cloned an older branch of the repository (one that had not been pushed to dev previously and therefore did not have the Tomcat update applied). When this branch was later pushed to dev, AquaScan flagged the P1 vulnerability.

The developer is new to RBC and did not resolve the issue immediately, but once identified, we reached out, removed the affected images from OCP via Kaibos, and confirmed they no longer exist in OCP. Screenshots showing this removal are attached.

As per Franklin’s feedback, the AquaScan report may take 2–3 days to reflect the change, so we expect the report to show no P1 vulnerabilities by Friday at the latest.

We will also be sending a note to the development team reminding them to avoid pushing older code containing the outdated Tomcat Embed Core dependency, as doing so will trigger a P1 vulnerability.

Please let me know if you need any further details in the meantime.

Regards,
Sherrell

Do you want me to also prepare the short developer advisory email that you’ll send out to the dev team so it aligns perfectly with this report? That way both communications are consistent.
