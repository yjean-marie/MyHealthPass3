Frontend Stories

1. Search and Display Client Data

Story Points: 2
Title: Search and Display Client Data
Description: As a KYC portal user, I want to enter search criteria and retrieve relevant client data.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Scenario: Search with required filters
  Given a user is on the client data page
  When they select at least two filter criteria and hit search
  Then the system should display relevant client data


---

2. Apply Filters Before Search

Story Points: 1
Title: Apply Filters Before Search
Description: As a KYC portal user, I want to filter client data before searching so that I only see relevant information.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Scenario: Apply multiple filters before searching
  Given a user is on the client data page
  When they select filters and hit search
  Then only clients matching the filters should be displayed


---

3. Display Error Messages

Story Points: 1
Title: Display Error Messages
Description: As a KYC portal user, I want to see meaningful error messages when something goes wrong.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Scenario: Display error message for failed API request
  Given an API request fails due to a network issue
  When the request does not return data
  Then the system should display "Unable to fetch data, please try again later"

Scenario: No data found
  Given a user submits search criteria
  When no clients match the selected filters
  Then the system should display "No clients match the selected criteria"

Updated Story Point Summary:

Backend Stories Total: 10 points

Frontend Stories Total: 4 points

Overall Total Estimate: 14 points (14 working days total, assuming a developer + QE collaboration on each)


Now, each story is sized to be completed within a day, ensuring both development and QE testing can be done effectively within your Agile approach.

Does this align better with your expectations?


9. Implement Alerting for Production Errors in ELK with Latency Monitoring

Story Points: 1
Title: Implement Alerting for Production Errors in ELK with Latency Monitoring
Description: As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts when critical errors occur in production or when API latency exceeds acceptable thresholds so that issues can be promptly addressed.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Scenario: Alert triggered for a critical error
  Given a critical error occurs in the system
  When the error is logged in ELK
  Then an alert should be generated and sent to the system administrator

Scenario: Alert triggered for repeated failures
  Given an API endpoint fails multiple times within a short period
  When the failure threshold is exceeded
  Then an alert should be sent indicating a possible outage

Scenario: Alert does not trigger for minor warnings
  Given a minor warning occurs in the logs
  When the system processes the log entry
  Then no alert should be triggered

Scenario: Alert triggered for high API response time
  Given an API request is processed
  When the response time exceeds 2 seconds
  Then an alert should be generated and sent to the system administrator

Scenario: Alert triggered for sustained latency issues
  Given API response time is consistently above 1.5 seconds for 10 consecutive requests
  When the system detects this trend
  Then an alert should be generated indicating potential performance degradation


---

Updated Story Point Summary:

Backend Stories Total: 11 points

Frontend Stories Total: 4 points

Overall Total Estimate: 15 points (15 working days total, ensuring both development and QE testing are covered)


This includes latency monitoring to ensure performance-related issues trigger alerts proactively. The implementation will likely involve configuring ELK queries or Prometheus alerts to detect response time anomalies.

Does this version align with what you need?



8. Validate User Token for API Access

Story Points: 2
Title: Validate User Token for API Access
Description: As a developer, I want the API to validate the user's token and verify their permissions before granting access to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the system.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format):

Scenario: Access granted for a valid token
  Given a user submits an API request with a valid token
  When the API verifies the token with the authentication service
  Then the request is processed successfully

Scenario: Access denied for an expired or invalid token
  Given a user submits an API request with an expired or malformed token
  When the API verifies the token with the authentication service
  Then the system should return an "Unauthorized" error

Scenario: Access denied for a user without proper permissions
  Given a user submits an API request with a valid token
  When the token is valid but lacks the required permissions
  Then the system should return a "Forbidden" error

Scenario: Token validation failure due to authentication service unavailability
  Given the authentication service is down
  When the API tries to validate the token
  Then the system should return a "Service Unavailable" error and log the failure


---

Updated Story Point Summary:

Backend Stories Total: 11 points

Frontend Stories Total: 4 points

Overall Total Estimate: 15 points


This updated version more accurately reflects the actual process, where the API receives a token, verifies it against an authentication service, and checks permissions before granting access.

Does this sound more like what’s happening in your implementation?
