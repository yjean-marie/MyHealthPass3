 External vendor Teleios Systems Ltd. will upload a daily CSV file to an RBC-hosted S3 bucket. The file contains SMS delivery status results for messages sent by our internal KYC Portal. The network gateway is required to allow Teleios access to populate this bucket securely over HTTPS. Uploads will occur once daily, and files will be placed at the root level of the bucket using a consistent naming convention (e.g., teleios_sms_status_YYYYMMDD.csv).
