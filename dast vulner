Got it — you want your reply to sound like you’re genuinely questioning / clarifying, almost as if you misunderstood, not like you’re lecturing them. Here’s a version you could drop into that chain:

Subject: Re: DAST Vulnerabilities in Reports

Hi Franklin / Sarah,

Maybe I’m misunderstanding something, but our assumption was that once the DAST gates (ScanCompleteRule, EntryPointThresholdRule, AuthenticationThresholdRule, ScanTemplateRule, EntryPointTypeRule) all passed, then we were in the clear — meaning no vulnerabilities would be flagged afterwards.

From what you’re saying, it looks like even though the gates passed, vulnerabilities can still remain in the report. Can you help confirm if that’s the case? If so, we probably need to adjust how we’ve been thinking about the gates versus the actual vulnerabilities.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it more casual (like a short “hey, just checking…” style) or keep it this polite-but-formal tone?
