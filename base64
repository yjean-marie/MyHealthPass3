You're likely using PowerShell on Windows, where base64 is not a recognized command. Here's how to handle base64 decoding in PowerShell to check your keystore certificate expiry using keytool:


---

✅ Step-by-step (PowerShell + Java keytool)

🔁 Step 1: Decode the base64 keystore string

Assuming your base64 content is in a file called keystore.b64:

$base64Content = Get-Content -Raw -Path "keystore.b64"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("decoded_keystore.jks", [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($base64Content))

> This creates a file decoded_keystore.jks from the base64 string.




---

🛠️ Step 2: Use keytool to check expiry

Run this in the same PowerShell window:

keytool -list -v -keystore decoded_keystore.jks

You’ll be prompted for the keystore password.


---

✅ Optional: Add alias and password directly

keytool -list -v -keystore decoded_keystore.jks -alias myalias -storepass yourPassword


---

Let me know if:

Your base64 string is in a variable instead of a file

You’re using .p12/.pfx format (use -storetype PKCS12)


I can tailor the command further if you share how you're storing or receiving the base64.
