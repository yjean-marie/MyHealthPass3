Adapt Quickly, Always Learn: "I demonstrated adaptability and a continuous learning mindset through my work on the core-agnostic layer, responding quickly to evolving requirements and client needs. For both the Originations and KYC Refresh programs, I moved swiftly to resolve defects, propose improvements, and adapt the EYP0 layer to align with the functional requirements of these programs. By actively addressing changes and anticipating client needs, I ensured our solutions remained relevant and effective in a fast-paced environment.

Additionally, I explored innovative approaches within the GenAI-powered knowledge-based chatbot, pushing the boundaries by integrating it with database queries to provide business insights directly from SQL. This capability not only added value to the chatbot POC but also demonstrated curiosity and a forward-thinking approach to utilizing AI and data integration. My efforts reflect a strong commitment to learning, flexibility, and innovation, aligning with RBC’s ambition to stay adaptable and responsive."
