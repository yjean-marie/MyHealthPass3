Sure! Here are the details for AO and S3 Fix presented in the same format as the table, using pipe (|) delimiter:

AO|restrain-cloud-api|develop-2024|Yes|Validated in QA|No|Predefined client with AO condition|Database data only (no schema)|Use specific client ID, validate message output|Shared QAT env|TBD|
S3 Fix|portal-cloud-api|develop-2025|Yes|Validated in QA after Vault update|No|Any client with notifications enabled|Vault configuration (service ID)|Restart container to pick up change|Shared QAT env|TBD|

Great question! Here's the distinction between the two:

Test Data Requirements

This refers to the specific data inputs needed to properly test a feature. It answers:

> What kind of mock or real data do I need to simulate the featureâ€™s behavior?



Examples:

A client with an active restraint (for Lift Restraint)

A staff user with a pending approval status (for Staff Notification)

A document mapped to a specific country and category (for Document Profile)


These are conditions or values testers must ensure are present before running a test.


---

Data Impact Area

This refers to the part of the system or database that the feature will interact with, modify, or depend on. It answers:

> Where in the system will data be read from, written to, or affected by this feature?



Examples:

Restraint status table (for Lift Restraint)

Vault configuration (for S3 Fix)

Document config tables (for Document Profile)


These define the scope of effect or risk, often used for:

rollback plans

audit impact

isolating data between tests



---

Think of it as:

Test Data Requirements = What I need to test

Data Impact Area = What gets touched/affected during testing


Would you like these definitions included on your Confluence page or tracker as a tooltip or note?
