Great â€” hereâ€™s a full breakdown of tasks, descriptions, and story point estimates for each notification type (SMS, Letter, Email) in CTF-5, assuming a Fibonacci-style pointing system (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). These estimates assume medium complexity and familiarity with the codebase.

ðŸ”” Notification Refactor Tasks (per notification type)

1. Update DAO/Repository to Use notification_transaction_master Table

Story Points: 3
Description:
Replace all references to the notice_v1 table with notification_transaction_master. Ensure correct mapping of fields to the normalized structure and adapt queries accordingly.


---

2. Refactor Service Logic to Fetch Client Profile via Client API

Story Points: 5
Description:
Remove dependency on the cz_ntft1_v1 table for client profile data. Integrate the Client API into the notification service, handle retries, and deserialize the profile into usable data structures.


---

3. Modify Notification Builder Logic

Story Points: 3
Description:
Update the logic that assembles the final notification message (SMS/email/letter) to source data from the new table and client API response. Ensure templates still render correctly.


---

4. Update Unit Tests to Reflect Table and API Changes

Story Points: 2
Description:
Refactor or add unit tests to mock the new API and DB sources. Validate that existing test coverage is maintained for all key logic paths.


---

5. Write New Integration Tests for Notification Flow

Story Points: 3
Description:
Develop integration tests that validate the full flowâ€”from fetching the notification record and client profile to sending the message. Focus on end-to-end correctness.


---

6. Update Configuration or Constants (if applicable)

Story Points: 1
Description:
Update environment configs or code constants that relate to table names, API endpoints, or notification types. Externalize where possible for future ease of change.


---

7. Perform Code Review and Static Analysis Checks

Story Points: 1
Description:
Submit the final code for peer review. Address review comments, run static analysis tools, and ensure compliance with internal coding standards.


---

8. Deploy to QA and Validate Notification Output

Story Points: 2
Description:
Deploy the changes to the QA environment. Trigger test notifications and confirm that both data and message output are accurate and reflect the refactored flow.


---

9. Document Changes in Internal Wiki or Release Notes

Story Points: 1
Description:
Create or update developer documentation outlining the new data flow, including table replacement, API integration, and testing notes for future reference.


---

ðŸ”¢ Total per notification type: ~21 story points

Let me know if you want this tailored for a smaller dev team (e.g., fewer points) or if you want a combined epic for all three notifications.
