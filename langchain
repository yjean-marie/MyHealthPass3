Yes, the code provided should serve as a functional outline, but to ensure that everything is aligned with the current version of LangChain, let's break it down in more detail.

Updated Key Components Based on Current LangChain Version

1. LangChain SQLDatabaseChain: This chain connects the language model to a database, generating SQL queries from natural language and executing them. LangChain's SQLDatabaseChain allows you to use OpenAI's models to create a natural language interface for your MSSQL database.


2. OpenAI API: The integration is straightforward, using LangChain’s OpenAI class for interactions with GPT models (like text-davinci-003 or gpt-4).



Here’s a revised version to reflect compatibility with the latest version of LangChain as of September 2024:

1. Install Latest Dependencies

You’ll want to make sure you have the latest versions of the required packages:

pip install langchain openai pyodbc fastapi uvicorn

2. Full Code for FastAPI + LangChain SQL Integration

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import openai
import pyodbc
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase

app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
openai.api_key = openai_api_key

# MSSQL Database connection
def get_db_connection():
    connection_string = (
        "Driver={SQL Server};"
        "Server=your_server_name;"
        "Database=your_database_name;"
        "UID=your_username;"
        "PWD=your_password;"
    )
    return pyodbc.connect(connection_string)

# Establish connection using pyodbc
conn = get_db_connection()

# Initialize OpenAI LLM with LangChain
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key)

# Create SQLDatabase object wrapping around the MSSQL connection
sql_db = SQLDatabase(conn)

# Define the SQL chain that connects the LLM (OpenAI) with the database
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain(llm=llm, database=sql_db)


@app.post("/insights/")
async def generate_insights(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    insight_request = data.get("insight_request", "")
    
    # Use LangChain's SQLDatabaseChain to generate the SQL and execute it
    try:
        result = db_chain.run(insight_request)
    except Exception as e:
        result = {"error": str(e)}

    return {"insight_request": insight_request, "result": result}

3. Explanation of the Code

OpenAI Class: This class handles interactions with the OpenAI API, providing the connection to models like GPT-4.

SQLDatabase: This is a wrapper around the database connection (in this case, MSSQL via pyodbc). It allows LangChain to understand the schema and generate appropriate queries.

SQLDatabaseChain: The key part of LangChain that takes natural language prompts, converts them into SQL queries using the LLM, and executes them on the database.


4. Testing and Usage

1. Start FastAPI:

Run the FastAPI app using the uvicorn command:

uvicorn main:app --reload



2. Sample Request:

You can send a POST request to the /insights/ endpoint with a JSON body:

{
  "insight_request": "Show me the total sales for the last quarter."
}

Expected Result: LangChain will interpret this request, generate an SQL query such as:

SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
WHERE SaleDate >= DATEADD(quarter, -1, GETDATE());

This query will be executed, and the result will be returned as a JSON object.





5. Compatibility with the Latest Version

As of September 2024, the provided code should work with the latest version of LangChain and the current APIs. However, here are a few points to check:

SQL Support: Ensure that the schema of your MSSQL database is correctly set up so that LangChain can parse and generate accurate SQL queries.

OpenAI Model: Depending on your OpenAI subscription, you may use gpt-4 instead of text-davinci-003 for better results, especially for more complex query generation.


6. Enhancements

Schema Information: If your schema is complex, you can pass additional schema metadata to LangChain to improve the accuracy of SQL query generation.

Clarifying User Input: For ambiguous queries, you can add another step using LangChain to prompt the user for clarifications before generating SQL.

SQL Query Validation: Always add a step for validating and logging the generated SQL to prevent errors or SQL injection.


This full code provides the complete implementation and is compatible with the current version of LangChain, ensuring that you can easily build out your POC.
