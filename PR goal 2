Here’s an enhanced comment that incorporates your achievement of including code and tests in all new project repositories, even if full coverage wasn’t achieved:

"This year, I made significant contributions to efficiency and cost management by integrating CI/CD practices and improving our approach to testing automation. We utilized Postman test scripts for API validation, allowing for quick and efficient testing after updates, which aligns with RBC’s 20% efficiency target in testing automation. Although these tests aren’t fully integrated into the pipeline yet, they have provided valuable time savings and consistency across our projects.

In line with the shift-left strategy, I ensured that all new project repositories included both code and initial tests. While our code coverage is still developing and not comprehensive, this foundation sets us up for stronger testing practices as we expand coverage over time. Additionally, all projects were deployed through Helios, supporting RBC’s focus on centralized deployment and automation. Looking forward, our goal is to enhance test coverage within the pipeline, building on this progress to further improve efficiency and deliver on RBC's operational excellence objectives."

This reflects both the achievements and areas for future growth, while staying aligned with the stated efficiency goals. Let me know if this captures everything accurately!
