Thank you for clarifying. Here’s an updated comment that integrates RBC’s leadership model and collective ambition, alongside your achievements:

"This year, I played an active role in advancing RBC’s efficiency and cost management goals by embedding CI/CD practices and strengthening our approach to testing automation. In alignment with RBC’s leadership model—particularly the principles of acting with speed and simplicity and continuously learning and adapting—I implemented Postman test scripts for API validation, which streamlined our testing process and contributed to the goal of a 20% efficiency gain in testing automation. While these tests are not yet fully integrated into the pipeline, they provide consistent, rapid validation, saving time and resources.

Embracing RBC’s collective ambition to support sustainable growth and operational excellence, I ensured that all new project repositories included both code and initial tests, aligning with our shift-left development strategy. Although current code coverage is limited, this foundational work lays the groundwork for more robust testing in the future. Additionally, adhering to centralized deployment through Helios supports our goal of maximizing productivity through standardized DevOps practices. Moving forward, I am committed to expanding our test coverage within the pipeline, further enhancing our impact on RBC’s goals of innovation and efficiency."

This version weaves in the leadership model's themes of adaptability, speed, and accountability, along with RBC's ambition for sustainable growth. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations!
