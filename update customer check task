Hereâ€™s an outline of the Jira task and acceptance criteria for the update:

Task Title:
Update T24 API to Check Customer ID Before Creating a Customer in VAR0

Task Description:
Currently, the update operation in the T24 API within the VAR0 app code allows a customer to be created if the customer ID is not found during an update. This task involves implementing a setting that checks whether the customer ID exists before proceeding with customer creation. If the customer ID does not exist, the creation should be halted, and an appropriate response should be returned.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):

Feature: Update Customer ID Check in T24 API for VAR0

  Scenario: Customer ID exists when updating a customer
    Given a valid customer ID is provided in the update request
    When the update operation is triggered
    Then the customer information should be updated successfully
    And no new customer should be created

  Scenario: Customer ID does not exist when updating a customer
    Given an invalid or non-existent customer ID is provided in the update request
    When the update operation is triggered
    Then the update operation should fail
    And no new customer should be created
    And an error message indicating "Customer ID not found" should be returned

  Scenario: Valid customer ID check enabled before creating a new customer
    Given the "Check customer ID before creation" setting is enabled
    When an update request is triggered with a non-existent customer ID
    Then the system should prevent the creation of a new customer
    And an error message indicating "Customer ID not found" should be returned

Would this meet your requirements, or would you like to adjust anything?
