Got it. Here's a revised version of your message to Adrian, incorporating both the screenshot’s context and your updated request about giving Tealios access to the dev S3 bucket:

Subject: Support Needed – S3 Access for Tealios

Hi Adrian,

Hope you’re doing well.

A while back, we granted streamlined access to an external vendor for our dev instance of S3 as part of the KYC project. They’ve been updating a delivery status file in our bucket as part of the mail delivery service integration.

We’re now looking to onboard Tealios, another external vendor, to do something similar — they’ll be uploading a daily status file related to SMS delivery. I’d appreciate your help in confirming what’s required to grant Tealios access to the same non-prod S3 instance.

Could you let me know:

Whether we can follow the same process as before?

If anything (e.g., credentials, whitelisting, endpoint exposure) needs to be set up or updated for their integration?


Let me know what steps we need to take from our side.

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you want a version that includes any names from the prior integration, or if you’d like to reference Kamad’s earlier help.
