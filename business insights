You're right in observing that this solution is primarily set up to work for direct insights from the tables, such as generating SQL queries based on structured data. For questions like "What business conclusions can be drawn from the KYC data?", which are more abstract and require a higher level of reasoning or interpretation, this solution would need additional layers.

Current Setup Limitations:

Direct SQL Generation: The current LangChain setup can generate and execute SQL queries based on the structure of the database, but it’s not inherently capable of making complex business inferences (e.g., drawing conclusions about business strategy) purely from structured data.


To handle business-level insights, you would need to integrate a few more components to go beyond SQL querying. Here's what you can consider:

Enhancing the System for Business Insights:

1. Data Summarization & Aggregation:

Extend the system to aggregate key metrics from the KYC data and summarize them.

Example: You could ask, “Summarize customer demographics from KYC data,” and it would generate SQL to pull out relevant statistics (age groups, regions, etc.).



2. Post-SQL Processing (Using Python):

After running the SQL query, you could perform statistical analysis or data processing in Python before passing the result back to the user. For example:

Identifying trends (e.g., increase in certain customer demographics).

Highlighting risk factors (e.g., customers flagged for additional KYC checks).

Analyzing regional distributions or behavior patterns.




3. Natural Language Inferences (Using GPT or Similar Models):

To draw business-level conclusions from the data, you can feed the summarized results back into an LLM (like ChatGPT), which can then reason about the data and provide more abstract insights.

Example Workflow:

1. User Prompt: "What business conclusions can be drawn from KYC data?"


2. LangChain SQL Query: Generates relevant SQL queries to pull KYC data (e.g., customer demographics, flags, etc.).


3. Data Analysis: Process the data to summarize key insights (e.g., percentage of flagged customers, trends in flagged accounts).


4. Conclusion Generation: Pass the summarized insights to the LLM, which can then generate business conclusions.





4. Example Python Integration: Here’s an outline of how you could enhance your current setup for this purpose:



from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase

app = FastAPI()

# Set up OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

@app.post("/business-insights/")
async def generate_business_insights(insight_request: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Generate SQL from user query (e.g., extracting KYC data)
    sql_db = SQLDatabase(engine)
    db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain(llm=llm, database=sql_db)

    try:
        # Get the SQL query results (e.g., KYC data)
        raw_data = db_chain.run(insight_request)

        # Perform any further data summarization/processing (Python logic here)
        # Example: Summarize customer demographics from KYC data
        summarized_data = summarize_kyc_data(raw_data)

        # Feed the summarized data back to GPT to get business-level insights
        conclusion_prompt = f"What business conclusions can be drawn from the following data: {summarized_data}"
        business_conclusions = llm.generate(conclusion_prompt)

        return {"insight_request": insight_request, "summary": summarized_data, "conclusions": business_conclusions}
    
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

def summarize_kyc_data(data):
    # Add logic to aggregate data, e.g., customer regions, demographics, etc.
    # This could involve Pandas, Numpy, or other analysis tools
    summary = {
        "total_customers": len(data),
        "flagged_customers": sum(d['flagged'] for d in data),
        # More aggregated metrics here
    }
    return summary

Key Considerations:

Data Aggregation: You’ll need to decide how to summarize data from the KYC tables (e.g., trends, outliers) before passing it to the language model for reasoning.

LLM Reasoning: After summarizing, using an LLM like GPT will help with more abstract business reasoning based on the data. For example, GPT can answer questions about potential risks or opportunities based on trends in KYC data.


Example Interaction:

User Prompt: "What business conclusions can be drawn from the KYC data?"

SQL Query: The system retrieves KYC data from the database, such as flagged customers, regions, and demographics.

Data Processing: Python logic summarizes the key metrics from the raw data.

Business Insight: GPT uses these summarized metrics to provide business-level insights (e.g., "There has been an increase in high-risk customers in the last quarter, particularly from regions A and B. This suggests a need to review onboarding processes in those areas.").


Next Steps:

1. Extend SQL Queries: Build SQL queries that extract business-relevant metrics from the raw KYC data.


2. Data Summarization: Use Python to summarize and aggregate these metrics.


3. LLM for Business Insights: Leverage the LLM to make higher-level business inferences based on the summarized data.



This enhanced workflow will help transform raw KYC data into business-relevant conclusions.



Here’s a general-purpose Python function that summarizes any dataset, regardless of the specific type of data. This function will generate high-level insights by analyzing key statistics about the data, such as counts, unique values, null values, and basic descriptive statistics for numeric columns.

The function uses Pandas to handle data analysis, as it is one of the most common and powerful libraries for this purpose.

General Data Summarization Function:

import pandas as pd

def summarize_data(data):
    """
    Summarize any data passed as input.

    Args:
        data (list of dicts or pandas DataFrame): The input data to summarize. This can be a list of dictionaries 
        or a pandas DataFrame.

    Returns:
        dict: A summary report with key statistics about the data.
    """

    # If the data is a list of dictionaries, convert it to a pandas DataFrame
    if isinstance(data, list):
        data = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Initialize a summary dictionary
    summary = {}

    # Basic Information
    summary['total_rows'] = data.shape[0]
    summary['total_columns'] = data.shape[1]
    
    # Summary of null values per column
    summary['null_values'] = data.isnull().sum().to_dict()

    # Summary of unique values per column
    summary['unique_values'] = data.nunique().to_dict()

    # Descriptive statistics for numeric columns
    numeric_summary = data.describe(include=[pd.np.number]).to_dict()

    # Summary for non-numeric columns
    non_numeric_summary = data.describe(include=[object]).to_dict()

    # Combine summaries into the final report
    summary['numeric_summary'] = numeric_summary
    summary['non_numeric_summary'] = non_numeric_summary
    
    # Column types
    summary['column_types'] = data.dtypes.apply(lambda x: str(x)).to_dict()

    return summary

How It Works:

1. Data Conversion: If the input data is a list of dictionaries (which often happens with SQL query results), the function converts it to a Pandas DataFrame for easier analysis.


2. Basic Statistics: The function calculates the total number of rows and columns, null values in each column, and the number of unique values in each column.


3. Numeric Data Summary: For numeric columns, it generates standard descriptive statistics like mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, etc.


4. Non-Numeric Data Summary: For non-numeric columns (e.g., text or categorical data), it generates basic statistics like the number of unique values and the most frequent values.


5. Column Types: It also returns the data types of each column.



Example Usage:

# Example data (can be any structured data)
data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "country": "USA", "salary": 70000},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "country": "Canada", "salary": 85000},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "country": "USA", "salary": 65000},
    {"name": "Diana", "age": None, "country": "USA", "salary": None},
]

summary_report = summarize_data(data)

# Print the summary report
import pprint
pprint.pprint(summary_report)

What the Summary Includes:

Total Rows/Columns: Basic dimensions of the dataset.

Null Values: A breakdown of how many null values are in each column.

Unique Values: Counts of unique values for each column.

Numeric Summary: Descriptive statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles for numeric columns.

Non-Numeric Summary: Most frequent values and unique counts for non-numeric columns.

Data Types: A map of column names to their data types.


Adaptations:

You can extend this function with more specific data aggregation methods if your dataset requires specialized treatment (e.g., more complex relationships between fields or specific domain knowledge).

This function is generic enough to handle most structured datasets and will give you a good starting point for more complex analysis.
