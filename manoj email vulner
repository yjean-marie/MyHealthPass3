I’ve reviewed the vulnerabilities that were flagged and they are all related to container image scanning results.
I’m currently working on addressing the core vulnerability itself by updating the affected library/packages and will provide confirmation once that is completed.
For context, identification wasn’t as immediate as before due to some visibility differences following the move to GitHub Actions, where these scan results are surfaced differently than they were previously.
I’ve set up a call with Kamad tomorrow to get clarity on why this is happening and to confirm whether adjustments are needed to how this stage is configured in our GitHub Actions workflow.
I’ll keep you posted on progress.
Thanks,
