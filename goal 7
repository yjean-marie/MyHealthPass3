Excellent — that’s exactly the detail I needed. You’ve now given enough to build a complete and accurate Operational Excellence feedback entry that aligns with your real work, RBC’s strategic language, and measurable outcomes.

Here’s the final version you can drop directly into your review form:

Goal: Operational Excellence

Objective: Deliver scalable, efficient, and resilient platforms, core systems, and operations.

My Feedback:
Over this review period, I contributed to multiple initiatives that strengthened platform efficiency, automation, and scalability within the KYC ecosystem.
I collaborated on the design and implementation of the Schedule Job API, which is now used across streams to standardize job tracking and automate status updates. This API-first approach simplified integration with other systems and reduced the manual overhead of monitoring job execution.
I also supported Stonebranch onboarding, which automated legacy cron jobs and improved deployment speed by reducing manual configuration steps (including Vault setup).
Additionally, I verified centralized Elastic logging across OCP4, ensuring improved visibility and enabling Production Support to monitor deployments in real time.
By leveraging Copilot for code generation, acceptance criteria drafting, and microservice-based design, I helped accelerate development cycles and enhance team productivity.
Collectively, these efforts improved scalability, reduced manual touchpoints, and strengthened operational reliability.

Self-Rating: ✅ Fully Met (Achieved All and Exceeded)
Rationale:

Enabled automation and reuse through Schedule Job API, adopted by other streams.

Improved deployment speed and reduced manual setup through Stonebranch and Vault integration.

Verified centralized Elastic logging and enhanced Production Support visibility.

Leveraged Copilot and microservice design principles to increase development efficiency.

Strengthened scalability and operational monitoring across the KYC ecosystem.
