Absolutely — here is a refined version of all three slides, with the second slide updated to align with your vision: each step in the KYC journey should “feed into” both the current process (Before Beacon) and the optimized version (After Beacon). This will give you a smooth narration structure and better visual clarity for your demo.

✅ SLIDE 1: “Know Your Client” Process – Current State

Slide Title

“Know Your Client” Process – Current State

Slide Content

(Visual: Horizontal flowchart with the following steps)

KYC Regulation

Gap Identification

Outreach to Client

Document Collection

Verification

Validation

KYC Update


(Overlay: Small callouts showing pain points per stage: e.g., “Manual effort,” “Rulebooks per jurisdiction,” “Human verification,” “Multiple follow-ups”)

Speaker Notes:

> Let’s begin with the current state of our KYC journey.

From left to right, we start with interpreting the KYC regulation and identifying what's missing — this differs across countries and products.

Once we identify a gap, outreach begins. This is where things slow down. Communication is manual, often 1-to-1, and clients don’t always respond promptly.

Document collection happens next. This means email threads, PDF attachments, calls — and a lot of back-and-forth.

Once we finally receive documents, verification and validation are manual too. Staff go line by line, checking whether documents meet criteria.

Only then can we update the system.

It’s a fragile process. Small errors lead to big consequences — missing a regulatory detail, incorrect data updates, or delayed processing. It’s not scalable or sustainable.

✅ SLIDE 2: How Beacon Solves the Problem

Slide Title

How Beacon Solves the Problem

Slide Content

(Split-screen layout: left = “Before Beacon,” right = “After Beacon”)
Overlay each of the 7 stages from Slide 1 — with parallel explanations:

Stage	Before Beacon (Manual)	After Beacon (With Automation)

KYC Regulation	Analyst manually checks PDFs, policies, and rulebooks	AI analyzes rules by jurisdiction + product instantly
Gap Identification	Staff determine gaps manually, using spreadsheets	Gaps are inferred through pattern detection and rules engine
Outreach to Client	Manual emails / letters / follow-ups	Auto-generated messages with links and status dashboards
Document Collection	Email attachments, uploads, multiple follow-ups	Single portal + reminders + receipt validation
Verification	Human verifies document types and validity	AI extracts and matches data to jurisdictional rules
Validation	Staff double-check entries and file status updates	Automated matching with exception alerts to staff
KYC Update	Manual updates into the backend systems	System updates automatically with optional staff review


(Footnote: Average time reduced from 10 days → 3 hours)

Speaker Notes:

> Here’s where Beacon radically changes the game.

For each step in the KYC process, we looked at what’s manual today — and reimagined it with automation and intelligence.

Rather than separate it out, we map each of the stages from Slide 1 across both the Before and After views here.

So at the top:
Instead of reading regulatory PDFs or interpreting legal policies manually, Beacon reads and parses those rules using GenAI.

It then moves into gap identification — no more Excel trackers. Beacon infers what’s missing based on product type, jurisdiction, and the client’s status.

Outreach is now automated. The system generates client messages with secure upload links and reminders.

On the document side, instead of getting attachments across email or scanning shared folders, Beacon provides a single portal that confirms receipt, type, and status.

And once documents are in, AI does the first round of verification: ID checks, expiration dates, matching required fields.

Validation still includes human oversight — but the errors are flagged automatically, not discovered too late.

Finally, Beacon updates the backend systems — seamlessly and securely.

This is not just faster. It’s auditable, compliant, and scalable.

✅ SLIDE 3: North Star Vision – AI-Driven KYC Agent

Slide Title

North Star Vision: AI-Driven KYC Agent

Slide Content

(Visual: Two sections — Left = “Client Experience”, Right = “Staff Experience” — with central node “Beacon AI KYC Agent” orchestrating both)

Client Experience:

Secure portal access

Upload docs & track status

Get real-time alerts

See completed requirements


Staff Experience:

Proactive refresh management

Automated gap analysis

Document verification

Backend integration + audit trail


(Footnote: GenAI + backend orchestration + KYC compliance engine)


---

Speaker Notes:

> This is the North Star — where we’re headed with Beacon.

The center of the system is an AI-driven KYC Agent — designed to assist both clients and staff.

For clients, we’re giving them transparency and control:
A clean portal to see what’s required, upload their documents, and track status — with notifications and timelines built in.

For staff, we’re automating the painful pieces:
Beacon knows when a refresh is due, what requirements are needed, and how to verify documents based on the rules.

This agent also integrates with our core systems and generates an audit trail, helping us stay on top of regulatory compliance.

This is not just automation for the sake of it — this is building a safer, smarter, and more scalable KYC process for RBC.
