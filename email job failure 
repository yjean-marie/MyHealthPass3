Perfect, I see the nuance you‚Äôre pointing out üëç. Let me rewrite the Issue Description section with your corrected breakdown ‚Äî still Jira-ready, still point-form, but clearer and polished:


---

Issue Description:

The email job is split into two main parts:

1. Process File

a) Send out emails.

b) Update log_records table for each record processed.


2. Iterate Through Log Records (for current date)

For each record, find the client_id in notice_transaction_master.

If found ‚Üí update the record.

If not found ‚Üí break the loop, which stops processing of all other records for the day.


Once the job fails, it populates a record in the log_records table with client_id = null.

In this case, the failure occurred because the CSV file that needed to be processed was not yet present in the S3 bucket.

The job was executed without the file in S3, which caused the failure and created a log_records row with a null client_id.

After the CSV was later placed in the S3 bucket and the job retried, processing hit the null client_id entry (processed in reverse order), which triggered the error again.


Root Cause:

Job execution without the required CSV in S3 caused a null client_id record to be inserted into log_records.

Subsequent runs fail once they encounter this null client_id in the processing sequence.


Resolution / Workaround:

Run a cleanup query to reset or adjust records where client_id is null.

The recommended query is to update those records to an older date (e.g., yesterday‚Äôs date) so they are skipped in current processing.


Sample Query Path (for resolution):

UPDATE log_records
SET created_at = DATEADD(day, -1, GETDATE())
WHERE client_id IS NULL;

Do you want me to also add a ‚ÄúSteps to Reproduce / Expected vs Actual Behavior‚Äù section so it reads more like a formal bug ticket in Jira?
