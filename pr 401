âœ… Pull Request Description:

> Resolved an issue where requests to the restrainer client via EYP0 were returning a 401 Unauthorized: nobody. While investigating, we initially addressed a separate EYP0 deployment issue caused by recent T24 upgrade changes. Once EYP0 was redeployed and functioning correctly, the 401 error persisted. Further investigation pointed to a compatibility issueâ€”likely due to the older RestTemplate-based HTTP client conflicting with recent changes in how RPG handles SSL certificates. A single line of code was added to explicitly set the SSL context, resolving the authorization issue during testing.

> Hey, just raising a quick PR to fix an issue Viraj picked up during testing. He was getting a 401 unauthorized from the restrainer client via EYP0. At first, we thought it mightâ€™ve been due to a separate EYP0 deployment problem from the T24 upgrade, but even after fixing that, the 401 persisted. Turns out itâ€™s likely due to a mismatch between the old RestTemplate client and changes in how RPG handles certs now. I added one line to explicitly set the SSL context, and it seems to have resolved the issue.

Let me know if you want it even more casual or more technical in tone.
