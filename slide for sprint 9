Speaker Notes (Detailed Context):


---

Stonebranch Deployment

Successfully deployed and validated the new Stonebranch job for production use.

Worked closely with QE and business to ensure successful integration and monitoring.


DAST Scan Fixes

Investigated and resolved several security vulnerabilities flagged by DAST.

Retested and validated all fixes in lower environments.


Lower Environment Deployment Issues

Still encountering issues in the lower environments during deployment.

Collaborating with infrastructure and QE to isolate and resolve the root causes.


Teleios SMS Delivery Status

Network Gateway Access Coordination: Identified the need for a gateway for Teleios/external vendor to access S3 bucket. Began coordination with internal teams for access provisioning.

Proof of Concept (POC): Built a quick POC to simulate the ingestion and processing of SMS delivery status files. A demo is scheduled to walk through the solution.

User Stories Finalized: Stories cover cron and API triggers, file validation, and database updates for delivery status. Ready for development kickoff.
