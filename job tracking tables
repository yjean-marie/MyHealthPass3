Absolutely! Below are all the CSVs in one message:

1. Job Tracking Table Fields

Field,Section,Description,Justification
job_id,Identification,Unique ID (UUID or int),Primary key for tracking the job
job_name,Identification,Name of job (e.g., kyc_batch_submit),Used for filtering, alerting
job_type,Identification,e.g., KYC, SYNC, BATCH,Groups jobs logically
section,Identification,e.g., RIBS, T24, ORIGINATIONS,Defines which business/technical area owns the job
environment,Identification,e.g., DEV, UAT, PROD,Critical for debugging, alerting
status,Lifecycle,Current state of job,Drives business logic and alerting
created_datetime,Lifecycle,When Stonebranch called Job Tracking API,Used to detect missing runs
actual_job_run_datetime,Lifecycle,When execution API began,Measures startup delay
updated_datetime,Lifecycle,When job last updated,For sorting and staleness
scheduler_start_time,Optional,When job was scheduled to run,Helps with SLA validation
scheduler_end_time,Optional,When job was scheduled to end,Used for runtime checks
retry_count,Retry,# of attempts for this job run,Used for retry logic and analysis
failure_code,Failure,Classifier for failure cause,Used for reports, alert routing
failure_error_message,Failure,Description of what failed,Helps triage and debug
failure_datetime,Failure,Timestamp of failure,Useful for analytics
comment,Ops,Free text from service or operator,Adds diagnostics or instructions
last_updated_by,Audit,Who or what system last updated the job,Optional for manual overrides
parent_job_id,Retry,Job ID of the previous attempt,Needed only if using new-row-per-retry strategy


---

2. Status Transitions

Current Status,Next Status,Trigger/Event,Notes
CREATED,RUNNING,Job Execution API starts,Service reports start of work
CREATED,CANCELLED,Manually or system aborted,Execution API was never called
CREATED,FAILED,Job Execution API never starts,Detected via monitoring or fallback logic
RUNNING,SUCCESS,Job completes successfully,Execution API sets status
RUNNING,FAILED,Job encounters error,Includes failure code/message
RUNNING,CANCELLED,Manually or system aborted,Timeout or user kill
FAILED,CREATED,Retry via new job record,Use parent_job_id to link
FAILED,RUNNING,Retry within same row (not preferred),retry_count increments


---

3. Use Cases That Informed Design

Use Case,Description,Related Fields
Track end-to-end lifecycle,Log from trigger to success/failure,status,created_datetime,actual_job_run_datetime
Audit and trace failures,Retain codes and error messages for failed runs,failure_code,failure_error_message
Retry tracking,Track how many times a job retried,retry_count,parent_job_id
Environment-specific debugging,Filter issues by environment,environment
SLA compliance,Compare expected vs actual times,scheduler_start_time,actual_job_run_datetime
Detect unstarted jobs,Find jobs stuck in CREATED,status,created_datetime
Monitor long-running jobs,Alert if job is RUNNING too long,updated_datetime,status
Ownership visibility,Group and filter jobs by team or business area,section,job_type


---

4. Retry Strategy Comparison

Strategy,Description,Pros,Cons
New Row per Retry,Create a new row each time with a link to previous attempt,"Full history, easy to audit","More rows, slightly more complex logic"
Same Row with Retry Count,Update the same row and increment retry_count,"Simple to implement, less storage","Overwrites history, hard to audit/debug"

Let me know if you want these exported to .csv files or formatted as documentation.
